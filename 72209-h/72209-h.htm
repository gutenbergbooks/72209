<hr class="decor width6 spaced2">

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> materials whence the
following biographical memoirs of the two young men who were knit
together in friendship, and whose adventurous enthusiasm led them
into the dangerous situation in which their lives were terminated,
have been drawn entirely from private and authentic sources of
information. The author had the satisfaction of being personally
acquainted with both the travellers, before they went to Africa,
and had, in consequence, the best opportunities of learning the
facts and circumstances of the previous part of their lives. But
the present publication, of which they are the subject, owes its
origin to an incidental conversation which he had with Dr. James
Kay, R.N. the intimate friend both of Oudney and Clapperton. Dr.
Kay not only had stored up in his memory many curious incidents and
anecdotes of his friends, which he communicated freely, but he had
in his possession a number of letters from them both, received
before and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> after they
had commenced their exploratory expedition. All these letters, with
a variety of other documents relative to them and their affairs,
were readily imparted to the author, to make whatever use of them
his judgment and discretion might dictate. When he had resolved on
publication, he mentioned his design to Professor Jameson, who, he
was aware, had been instrumental in getting both our travellers
appointed to the mission, in the accomplishment of which they went
to Africa. The Professor not only approved of the design, but
afforded the author essential service in its execution, by putting
into his possession a file of letters from Dr. Oudney, written
during the prosecution of his African expedition, and addressed,
some of them to the Professor, and the rest of them to the
traveller’s eldest sister. Professor Jameson, likewise, mentioned a
number of interesting particulars relative chiefly to the
arrangements of the expedition, and the views of the gentlemen by
whom it was undertaken. The author is farther indebted for a part
of his information to Lieutenant Sheriff, R.N. who had lived in
habits of the closest intimacy with Captain Clapperton, during a
series of years, and had become well acquainted with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> his history. Dr. Kay,
moreover, applied to Mr. Anderson, formerly a resident in the West
Indies, afterwards in Edinburgh, and now in the vicinity of
Birmingham, also one of Captain Clapperton’s friends, to
communicate what he recollected of him worthy being made public;
and in reply he sent a letter, which was also given to the author,
containing many valuable facts relating to an important period of
Clapperton’s life; and stating the dates and particulars of a great
part of his public career as an officer in the Navy, as well as
mentioning a number of incidents, sentiments, and conduct,
illustrative of his character as a private individual. These are
the materials out of which the following narratives have been
composed, and while, it is hoped, they will have the effect of
preserving the memory of two interprising men who sacrificed their
lives in the discharge of their duty, from being lost in oblivion,
they will, at the same time, serve to assure the reader, that he
may safely repose the most unlimited confidence in the accuracy of
their details.</p>

<p>After both the memoirs had been composed, and indeed printed in
a different form to that in which they now appear—a
circumstance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
which will account for the frequent use of the editorial
<span class="sc">we</span>—the Author had the good fortune to meet
with Captain Clapperton’s sister, from whom he received some
valuable information respecting the early part, especially, of her
adventurous and lamented brother’s life. In consequence of this
accession of materials, he has been enabled to correct several
passages, and greatly to enrich his narrative. And now he begs
leave to offer his cordial thanks to that lady, as well as to all
the gentlemen mentioned above, to whom he has been so much
indebted.</p>

<p>With regard to the Memoir of Major Laing, the Author of those of
Oudney and Clapperton must disclaim both the merit and the
responsibility. It was compiled from a variety of previously
published notices of that gentleman, who like many others met an
early grave in the interior of the African continent. As, however,
he was the countryman of the other two travellers, and met his
death while engaged in the discharge of similar duties, as well as
nearly about the same time, the accompanying notice of his career
seems to form a suitable companion to the narratives in which
theirs are recorded.</p>

<hr class="decordb width6 spaced2">

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Although</span> biography be the
most attractive species of historical composition, as it gratifies
the prying curiosity of our nature by making us acquainted with the
origin and progress, and the retired habits, as well as the public
pursuits, conduct, and character of distinguished individuals; yet
there are few, comparatively speaking, of the human race, the
actions of whose lives possess sufficient interest to engage the
attention of their fellow-men, or are, on that account, worthy to
be made the subject of biographical record. Had, therefore, Dr.
Oudney’s name not been associated with that select band of
enterprising men whose love of scientific adventure caused them to
forego their native country and the endearments<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> of home, and to wander in foreign
lands, till they fell the victims of their own enthusiasm; we are
ready to grant that, in all probability, notwithstanding his
accomplishments and his worth, he would have been allowed to rest
uninquired after with those millions of mankind who, the feverish
bustle of life being over, have become “to dumb forgetfulness a
prey.” But as he had the ardour of mind to undertake an expedition
into the interior of Africa with the view of enlarging the
dominions of science, and the perseverance to prosecute the
enterprise, till, like others who had preceded him in the same
career, he sacrificed his life in the performance of his duty; the
incidents of his history have thereby acquired an interest, which,
in other circumstances, they could not have possibly possessed;
and, hence, a short memoir of his life cannot fail to afford a high
gratification to a numerous class of readers; and this it is the
object of the following pages to supply.</p>

<p>Doctor Walter Oudney was born, of humble parentage, in the
vicinity of Edinburgh, in the month of December, 1790. From his
boyhood he discovered an uncommon disposition and aptitude for
learning; so that he could scarcely be induced to take the
necessary hours of repose. It does not appear, however, that at
this early period he manifested that inclination for travelling or
adventure which afterwards operated so powerfully on his mind, and
which seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
been entirely the result of his professional occupation as a
surgeon in the Royal Navy. Having found the means of attending the
medical classes in the university of Edinburgh, he applied himself
with indefatigable ardour to his studies, though we are not aware
that he gained any other distinction beyond that of the esteem of
his class-fellows, and the approbation of the respective professors
under whom he studied; with some of whom he continued on terms of
intimate friendship till the day of his death. Having passed the
necessary examinations, and taken his surgeon’s degree, he
experienced little difficulty, during the late extensive and long
continued war with France, of obtaining an appointment as a surgeon
in the royal navy. In this capacity he was employed, during a
series of years, on various stations, and among others in the
Indian ocean; and throughout the whole of that important period of
his life, while he was assiduous in the prosecution of his
professional studies, he was, at the same time, particularly
careful to increase the quantity, and to extend the sphere of his
general knowledge. For this laudable purpose, he applied himself
with diligence to the reading of the Greek and Latin classics, and
made great progress in the acquisition of the French, the Italian,
and several other of the modern languages of Europe.</p>

<p>When, by means of the noble perseverance and the heroic bravery
of Great Britain and her allies, the terrible and desolating war
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> had broken out at
the French revolution—a war which involved not only the whole of
Europe, but the greater part of the world at large in its
interests, and which, during a long series of years, was carried on
with unexampled pertinacity and magnitude of effort, both by sea
and land—had ended in the subversion of the usurped power of
Napoleon Bonaparte, and the restoration of the exiled princes of
Bourbon to the royal authority which had been so long exercised by
their ancestors, and when thereby peace was once more allowed to
revisit the almost exhausted nations of Europe; Mr. Oudney, with
thousands of his countrymen, had an opportunity of returning to his
native country, and of revisiting the city in which he had received
his education, and with which, consequently, he had many endearing
and tenderly-cherished associations. He was now a naval surgeon on
half pay, and, we believe, in the prospect of some prize-money;
and, what must have been peculiarly agreeable to his mind, which
was eminently gentle, sedate, and full of sensibility, he had an
opportunity of witnessing the grateful and enthusiastic exultation
which was exhibited by all ranks and descriptions of men for the
gallant and signally important achievements, which, for the benefit
and honour of the country, had been accomplished by the service
with which he had been so long connected, and by which the dignity
and the independence of the British empire had been so gloriously
sustained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>Mr. Oudney, on his
return, found his mother and his young sisters residing in
Edinburgh, and with these near relations, who ever were, and
continued to the last to be, the objects of his duteous affection
and tender solicitude, he once more domesticated; and while he
treated his mother, now advancing into the vale of years, with the
respectful attention and kindness which filial regard alone can
dictate, he was to his sisters at once a father and a brother. He
put them in the way of receiving a good education, was careful to
impress upon their minds the lessons of virtue and religion, and
introduced them to society of a higher grade than, without his
assistance, they could have hoped to associate. Indeed, during the
whole period of Mr. Oudney’s public service, his mother and his
sisters had never ceased to engage his solicitous attention; and to
assure them of his affection towards them, and of his desire to
minister to their comfort, he had from time to time sent them money
so long as his public duties kept him at a distance from their
society. This fact, so worthy of being recorded and remembered to
Mr. Oudney’s honour, is a proof that his mind, which had been early
impressed, continued to be steadily actuated, by a sentiment, which
has long formed a distinguishing feature in the character of the
Scottish peasantry; namely, the obligation so deeply felt, and so
generally acted upon by them, of contributing to the support of
their aged and dependent relatives.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_6">[6]</span> To form and to cherish this generous principle
in the minds of the young, constitutes a part of their religious
education, and hence spring many of those pure and lofty virtues
which are often seen exemplified even in the humblest walks of
life, and which are nowhere depicted with more truth and feeling
than in the immortal pages of Burns. This is a trait in the
Scottish character which is truly ennobling, and which we fondly
hope no change of manners will ever weaken or efface.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Oudney had settled in Edinburgh he resumed his
professional studies, and having completed the <em>curriculum</em>,
prescribed to those who wish to take the degree of Doctor of
Medicine, he obtained that academical rank upon the first of August
1817, his inaugural dissertation being “<em>De Dysenteria
Orientali</em>,” a subject to which his attention was doubtless
directed by having had an opportunity of observing the character
and treatment of that disease during the period of his naval
practice. He now became a medical practitioner in Edinburgh, and
was very careful to observe and record the symptoms and
circumstances which, in that capacity, came under his notice. While
he was thus employed, he was in the habit of imparting the result
of his observations to his medical friends, and among others, to
Dr. Abercrombie of this city, who, once and again, in his
communications to the “Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,” has
mentioned Dr. Oudney with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_7">[7]</span> approbation, and incorporated his young
friend’s information with that of his own. We likewise observe in
the same Journal (for July 1820) a paper by Dr. Oudney, entitled,
“Cases of <em>Ileus</em> from a twist of the colon,” and we are
assured on the authority of one of the most intimate of his medical
friends, that he frequently sent communications to the “London
Medical Journal.” At this period he was assiduous in the study of
chemistry and natural history. Botany, especially, engaged much of
his attention; and, we believe, he was indebted to the late Dr.
Scott for much valuable information on this interesting department
of physical knowledge. He and Dr. Scott commenced a botanical work
on the grasses; he was employed by Dr. Duncan in arranging the
plates of a botanical work belonging to the university library;
and, we have been told, that at one time he entertained serious
thoughts of becoming a lecturer on British botany. We know that he
was enthusiastically attached to this study, and oftener than once
we have accompanied him when he went on botanical excursions. He
not only attended the natural history class in the university of
Edinburgh, so ably taught by Professor Jameson, but he became
likewise a member of the Wernerian Natural History Society, which,
under the auspices of the same professor, has long held a
conspicuous place among the scientific associations of the
country.</p>

<p>It is a singular circumstance in the feelings<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> and character of Dr. Oudney, that
although the sedateness of his disposition and the benevolence of
his heart made him enjoy the quietness and the comfort of home, and
the interchange of the kind affections with his relations and
friends around the domestic hearth, with a peculiar degree of
satisfaction; although his steadiness and attention, joined to his
professional experience and skill, were fast procuring for him an
extensive medical practice; and although he could have formed a
matrimonial alliance both agreeable to his feelings and
advantageous to his prosperous establishment in life: yet, such was
his love of distinction as a scientific traveller, and so strong
was his desire of exploring distant, and of discovering unknown
regions, that he was willing, for a while, to forego every other
consideration for the sake of gratifying this master-passion of his
mind. The hope of having it in his power of visiting foreign
countries, and of extending the boundaries of physical knowledge,
stimulated him to persevere in those scientific pursuits which were
especially fitted to qualify him for accomplishing this purpose on
which he had so steadfastly set his heart; and caused him to make
his sentiments on this subject known to such individuals as he
supposed had influence sufficient to promote the object which he
had in view. For this end, he would have had no objections to have
resumed his public services as a naval surgeon, trusting that he
might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> sent to some
station favourable for prosecuting the inquiries which he was so
anxious to make. But the interior of Africa was the field of
investigation on which his own wishes were bent. The
considerations, that the climate of that country had been fatal to
so many former travellers, and that its inhabitants had showed
themselves averse to have it traversed by strangers, were unable to
exert an influence over his mind sufficiently strong to deter him
from engaging in the enterprise if he should have it in his power
to make the attempt. He felt that his constitution was vigorous; he
had already acquired some knowledge of tropical climates; and he
trusted that he possessed prudence and precaution sufficient to
enable him to surmount every opposing obstacle, and to conduct any
expedition on which he might be sent to a favourable and
satisfactory issue. And sooner, we believe, than he expected, he
had an opportunity of putting his sanguine anticipations to the
test of experiment.</p>

<p>When it was known that government had resolved to send a new
expedition to explore the central parts of Africa, and especially
to trace the course, and endeavour to ascertain the termination of
the Niger, Dr. Oudney, through the influence of Professor Jameson,
along with Major Denham, and Captain Clapperton, was, greatly to
his own satisfaction, appointed on this interesting mission. He had
no fears of losing his health by travelling, was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> very sanguine that his labours
would be crowned with success, and, being amply provided with
instructions, by his friend Professor Jameson, how to prosecute his
inquiries, and to collect and preserve specimens of the natural
productions of the countries he was about to visit, he took
farewell of his friends in Scotland and went to London in the
summer of the year 1821. And we are peculiarly happy, that by means
of a regular series of letters to his eldest sister, and to some
other of his correspondents, we are enabled not only to make him
give a luminous account of the rest of his career, but also to
impart much new and valuable information respecting the countries
in which he travelled. The first of the Doctor’s letters from which
we shall take an extract, is one which he sent to his friend Mr.
James Kay, surgeon of the Royal Navy, from London, on the eve of
his setting out on his expedition.</p>

<p>“Here I am actively engaged in business of one kind or another.
But I expect to finish and arrange every thing to day; for it is
probable Clapperton and I shall depart to-morrow morning, unless
the mail be detained a few days, a thing which I understand often
happens. I have found every thing very agreeable here. Those with
whom I have had to deal have been exceedingly polite, and in most
respects have forwarded my views as far as possible. Our worthy
friend Clapperton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
gets on amazingly well. I am in high spirits respecting my mission;
from all that I have been able to learn, very little danger, and
scarcely any impediments, are to be apprehended. We have got
excellent fowling-pieces and pistols, and a most valuable
assortment of philosophical instruments. The former, I hope, except
for the purposes of natural history, will scarcely be required—an
agreement exists between the British government and the pasha of
Tripoli respecting the conveying of travellers safe to Bornou,
therefore, so far as he is concerned, all is safe.”</p>

<p>The next letter in the series from which we shall quote is
addressed to his eldest sister, and is dated “Malta, October 17,
1821.”</p>

<p>“This is certainly a curious island, it was originally a barren
rock, but the labour of man has done wonders. Soil has been
transported from different places, on which many gardens have been
formed. The town is a strong fortress, celebrated in history for
the noble stand which it made against the whole power of the
infidels. You can have no idea of the houses from any thing you see
in Edinburgh. The roofs are all flat, and well fitted for a warm
climate. The entrance is capacious and gloomy, not unlike that of
ancient baronial castles. The rooms are lofty, the floors of which
are paved with stone; and the walls are generally decorated with
large paintings. There is one very fine church, St. John’s, the
floors of which are all of the finest marble,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_12">[12]</span> with some fine specimens of mosaic work,
and the walls are adorned with beautiful paintings and well
executed sculpture. There are, however, many marks of decay on the
exterior of the building, which, by the bye, does not present that
grand appearance that one would expect.”</p>

<p>The two letters which follow in the series are both dated
“Tripoli, October 24, 1821,” and relate principally to what
occurred on the passage from England to Africa.</p>

<p>“We are here at last, and a pretty place it is; so built,
however, that three can scarcely walk a-breast in the streets:
every few yards a house is in ruins, for there exists among the
Moors a strange dislike to repair any thing, particularly houses.
Whether that arises from indolence or superstitious notions, I
cannot tell, but the fact is evident to the most superficial
observer. Our passage to Malta was exceedingly agreeable—long
certainly, but pleasant company prevented <em>tedium</em>. I
visited the galleries at Gibraltar, and was highly pleased with the
grandeur of the design. Your favourite fort, Malta, excited very
little interest in my mind, not that the place is deficient in
interest, but we were fretful from experiencing great harassment
from individuals who ought to have forwarded our views, so that a
disinclination to enjoy any thing was induced. On our arrival here,
we found matters far beyond our expectation; far to the south of
Bornou is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> open to us,
and almost entirely subject to the pasha of Tripoli. All our route
is clear and free from danger. The pasha’s word is a law not to be
disobeyed, and he has pledged himself to protect us fifty-seven
days’ journey beyond Bornou. On our landing, that favourable
intelligence made us leap for joy. The Mahometans here are a most
liberal sort of men, and tolerate people of every religious
persuasion—a circumstance almost unknown in any other Mahometan
country. The police is admirable, so that a stranger may traverse
every part of the city without the least apprehension. As to the
moral condition of the people, I can say but little, as I have had
very imperfect opportunities of observing them.</p>

<p>“I must now describe to you my introduction to the pasha. The
court-yard was filled with people of very different complexions,
mostly the servants, guards, and relations of the pasha. The group
had a most motely appearance; many were superbly dressed, others
were in rags and filthy in the extreme. The room in which his
Highness was seated was decent, with nothing gaudy. He sat at the
farther end of the room, and his two sons sat on chairs at the
other end of it; while many of his guards and ministers stood in
different positions round the chamber. He was grave, and his
muscles were as motionless as those of a statue, so much so that I
was several times inclined to laugh. The gravity, however, ceased
after a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
conversation, and then a scene was displayed far from being
disagreeable. He conversed with apparent pleasure on the success of
his arms, and on the great distance to which he could convey the
mission in perfect safety. That, you may be assured, was agreeable
intelligence to us, and inspired us with hopes of almost certain
success. I had to prescribe for him, for no sooner had I entered
the room than my advice was requested. The two sons present were
tolerably good-looking men; the elder of them was corpulent and
very like his father; and the younger of them tall, slender, and,
upon the whole, a good-looking young man. The pasha’s dress was
clean, plain and neat. I hope we shall be able to set off early in
December—a fine season for travelling—and expect to eat our new
yearday’s dinner in Mourzuk. We travel in European dresses, and in
this respect we shall be different from most of the former
travellers in this part of Africa. The pasha approves of our
resolution, and the consul is highly delighted with it. Indeed, on
reflecting seriously on the matter, I think the plan is by far the
most judicious. Hypocrisy almost always engenders suspicions; and
the people well know that our pretensions to be of their religion
are only feigned.”</p>

<p>With regard to the last-mentioned statement of the above letter,
we know that Dr. Oudney was resolute in his determination not to
travel under an assumed name and character.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_15">[15]</span> He was too sincere and conscientious a
Christian ever to venture to lay aside the avowed practice of its
duties for the attainment of any purpose whatsoever. He was
strongly urged by some of his scientific friends to endeavour to
control his scruples on this subject, and, like his predecessors in
the same scheme of exploring Africa, to travel as an Arab and a
disciple of Mahomet, but without success; and he declared that he
would far rather abandon the enterprise to which he had been
appointed, than even in appearance to renounce his faith. It so
happened that the humour of the pasha of Tripoli, and the
circumstances of his dominions at the time they were traversed by
the mission to which Dr. Oudney was attached, favoured his design.
It is quite clear neither Dr. Oudney nor his companions could have
travelled in Africa as Mahometans, from their comparative ignorance
of the languages of the east, and of the rites of the religion of
the Arabian prophet. None of them had the preparatory training
previous to the commencement of their journey as was enjoyed by
Burckhardt and others; so that they must have been quickly detected
as impostors had they assumed the profession of Islamism; and it is
very true, as the Doctor remarks, that an exposed hypocrite is an
odious character in any country. It is quite obvious, however, that
the more familiar travellers are with the language of the people
among whom they travel, and the better acquainted they are with
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> manners and
customs, and their religious tenets and ceremonies, they will
thereby best secure their confidence, and be the better enabled to
adapt themselves to all circumstances, persons, and seasons, which
they may meet with, as well as greatly increase their means of
obtaining the knowledge of which they are in search. But whether
Dr. Oudney’s declared resolution to travel as an Englishman and a
Christian be approved of or not; or whether his conduct in this
respect may or may not be imitated by others, every one must admire
the honest sincerity of heart, and the unbending integrity of
principle which his resolution manifested. There is another letter
to his sister of the same date as the preceding, which likewise
contains some facts worthy of being published.</p>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Tripoli, October 24</em>,
1821.</p>

<p>“It is with the sincerest joy I communicate to you my safe
arrival here. Every thing smiles and promises complete success to
our enterprise. Accounts arrived here a few days ago, that the
pasha’s army had penetrated to fifty-seven days’ journey beyond
Bornou—a circumstance exceedingly favourable to us, as no danger
need be apprehended the greater part of the way we design to take.
This town has a very indifferent appearance. I expected to see
numerous domes and gilded minarets, but such is not the case; a few
ill-shaped plain minarets are the only objects that relieve the
eye. The houses are clumsily<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_17">[17]</span> built, with windows looking into a square
court. The roofs are all flat, and on them the Moors enjoy
themselves in the evenings, smoking their pipes. The streets are
narrow, and, from the deficiency of windows, have a very sombre
effect. The inhabitants consist of Moors, Jews, Christians, and
Negroes; and although most of them are poor and filthy, and live in
miserable dwellings, yet they may be regarded as happy; for there
is here more toleration than in any other Mahometan country.</p>

<p>“I have been presented to the pasha. He was sitting, with great
dignity, on his couch, in the manner of eastern princes, and with a
slight nod returned our salutations: he appeared to be about the
middle size—very corpulent—and apparently about forty years of age.
He was grave—a necessary part of the ceremony, I suppose—for it
vanished considerably when he began to converse. He promised us
every protection through all his dominions, which extend far to the
south, and said he should astonish Britain by the distance he could
conduct us all in safety into the interior of the country. The
castle he inhabits is far from being neat and clean, and many of
his attendants present a very shabby appearance. The neighbouring
country has nothing prepossessing; a few date and other trees line
the outskirts of the town; but for many miles beyond this there is
nothing but sand. In a few days we intend to make an
excursion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> with a
party into the mountains, and to the remains of an ancient Roman
city. In my next, I shall give you some particulars of the
excursion.”</p>

<p>None of the letters in our possession contain any thing relative
to the mountains or the antiquities in the neighbourhood of
Tripoli; but we remember to have heard extracts of a letter from
Dr. Oudney to one of his friends in Edinburgh, dated Tripoli, 30th
of October 1821, in the Wernerian Natural History Society; and
these extracts formed the result of the excursion which he tells
his sister he intended to make to the mountains of Tripoli and to
the ruins of a Roman city. His next letter to his sister is dated
Tripoli, December 10th, 1821, in which he says—</p>

<p>“I am busy making preparations for my journey, which I expect to
commence about a fortnight hence. Every thing goes on well, and the
prospects of success are of the most promising kind. The climate
here is delightful, neither too hot nor too cold, but a just
medium. A considerable degree of cold, however, may be expected
during the time of part of our journey; but it is easier to remedy
cold than heat. My health is excellent, and I hope it will continue
so.”</p>

<h3 class="med">TO THE SAME.</h3>

<p class="right">“<em>Gardens near Tripoli, February 18</em>,
1822.</p>

<p>“I cannot take my departure without telling<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_19">[19]</span> you that I am well and happy. I should
have left Tripoli yesterday had the weather been favourable; and if
it be fine to-morrow I shall go. Every circumstance promises a
prosperous journey, and in a short period you may expect gratifying
intelligence. Our cavalcade is large, consisting of thirty camels
at least, and several horses and mules. We have abundance of every
thing, and consequently expect to be very happy. Clapperton is
well, and sends his best compliments to you.”</p>

<h3 class="med">TO THE SAME.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Mourzuk, April 12</em>, 1822.</p>

<p>“I arrived here on the seventh instant, in high spirits and the
best health. Our journey to this place was exceedingly pleasant,
and far surpassed my most sanguine expectations. The people have
all been exceedingly kind, and have treated us in the best manner
possible. Every respect has been shown us since we left Tripoli,
and we have not experienced the slightest difficulty, or been
exposed to the least danger. The country over which we passed was
dreary in the extreme. In many places not a blade of grass, nor a
single shrub, for several days together, was visible.
Notwithstanding that circumstance, there is always something
interesting in Nature; even in her most sterile states there are
objects to observe and admire. The different <em>Oases</em>, in our
way, were visited with pleasure, and the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> flowing accounts which travellers have given
of these spots were found to possess a considerable degree of
correctness. It is only necessary for a person to be travelling for
several days over nothing but gravelly and sandy plains, to have
his mind brought into a fit state to admire these fertile spots. It
is as yet doubtful how long I may be obliged to remain here; but
you may rest assured it will be as short a time as possible. The
town is much better than I expected, and the house allotted for the
accommodation of the mission is a very excellent one. The principal
people have treated us with every kindness, and all endeavour to
make us as comfortable as possible.”</p>

<h3 class="med">TO THE SAME.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Mourzuk</em>, May 12, 1822.</p>

<p>“Here I am, thank God, well and happy. The climate is hot, but I
have not experienced it very disagreeable. My health, indeed, has
been better since I left home than it was for a long time before.
Clapperton and I have been visiting a number of different places,
and intend spending our time in that way for the next two months,
when I hope we shall be able to proceed to Bornou. The soil is
sandy, and we have no other tree but that of the date. There is,
however, abundance of this sort, and its fruit forms the principal
sustenance of many thousands of the people.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_21">[21]</span> Without this tree, the whole country, from
this place to Bornou, would be a dreary waste. You perhaps know
that no rain falls here; on that account corn fields and gardens
are not to be expected. At the expense, however, of much labour and
care, as the ground requires to be continually watered by streams
from the wells, we have many of both. We have always plenty of good
water, at all times, a circumstance which, in a country destitute
of rain, you will be apt to think is rather singular and curious,
but it is one which you cannot be expected to understand were I to
enter into any explanation of it. All the places in Fezzan exhibit
a sameness of aspect. The towns are formed of mud houses, generally
of one flat; they have, for the most part, an old ruined castle in
the centre; and all of them are surrounded by walls. On the outside
of the towns, and in some places within the walls, a few abodes are
constructed of the leaves of the palm. The people are really a fine
race, and have uniformly treated us with the greatest kindness.
Wherever I go, and every day that I remain in this town, I have
numerous applications for medicines. Some of the applicants have
very curious complaints, which, were I to state them to you, would
make you laugh heartily. Many of them, however, are real, and for
which I can in general prescribe something for their relief. We are
much better here than we could have been in Tripoli. We meet every
day with persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> from
the country we are going to visit, and from those through which we
have to pass. We thus make friends that may be of considerable
service to us in our future investigations. We are all living
comfortably, in a tolerably good house in the castle; and often in
the mornings, about sunrise, take a ride round the town. It is not
safe to go out much in the sun; we, therefore, in this respect,
follow the example of the natives, and stop within during the heat
of the day.”</p>

<p class="space-above15">The Doctor’s next letter is addressed to
Professor <span class="sc">Jameson</span>, and is dated “Mourzuk,
June 6, 1822.”—This letter is valuable, both as it is expressive of
his affectionate and grateful remembrance of his friend and patron,
and as it conveys the result of his own observations of the
physical state of the country which he had visited, to one whom he
well knew could duly appreciate the value of his remarks; and who,
at any rate, as they had reference to Natural History, he was
aware, would regard them as the best return he could make for the
kindness he had previously received from the Professor. We likewise
think that the letter is made up of matter sufficiently interesting
to a large proportion of our readers, to excuse us for transcribing
it entire. While it tends to illustrate Dr. Oudney’s character, it
shows, at the same time, the devotion of his mind to the objects of
his mission to Africa.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">My Dear Sir</span>,—I intended to have
written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> you long ago,
but my time has been so occupied by such a variety of objects, that
really I could not. I am much disappointed in the climate of
Fezzan, agreeably so; the temperature under cover is not much
greater than in other places in the same parallel of latitude. Now
it is June, and the <em>maximum</em> of daily heat is seldom above
90 degrees, while the <em>minimum</em> is about 80 or 78 degrees of
Fah. The air is dry, as indeed several of my instruments show too
well; for the ivory on several has shrunk so as to render them
useless. The tube of one of the attached thermometers is bent like
a bow from being confined. In another, the pressure of the glass
has broken the brass clasps. The Hygrometer of Kater, generally
stands at 38 or 38.5. Instruments affected by the hygrometrical
state of the air, and by sound, are useless in a climate such as
this. I mention sound, for instruments which act by delicate wheels
are very soon deranged, and disappoint the scientific inquirer. The
Barometer varies a little: there is always a change, particularly
from 11 A.M. to 8 or 9 P.M. The mercury becomes depressed, in
general, about the 20th part of an inch, sometimes, however, nearly
a 10th. During northerly winds, the mercury rises, and in most
cases, the stronger the breeze the greater the rise; from that
circumstance, I have been able to predict strong breezes from that
direction. On the contrary, southerly winds cause depression, and
that commonly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
proportion to the violence of the wind. I have not yet calculated
the mean height, but it must be about 28.600 inches at the
temperature of 80 Fah. Water boils at 207 Fah.; and both of these
circumstances indicate a considerable elevation.</p>

<p>I have anxiously searched for springs, but have found none fit
for an accurate result. The whole country is a spring, if I may use
the expression, for water comes bubbling up on digging a few feet;
its temperature then is affected by the earth, and the heat
indicated is of no use in ascertaining the mean temperature of the
place, and consequently its elevation. The abundance of water in a
country in which rain scarcely ever falls, and in which there is no
dew, is a curious and interesting circumstance to the philosophic
inquirer. It is not generated in the earth, and it cannot be
supplied by the sea. From whence then does it come? Is it from the
tropical rains? Or is it from rivers lost in the earth? The supply
is constant, and the wells yield as much at one time as another.
The supposition that appears most probable to me is, that the
countries to the southward are much higher than this, that during
the rainy season water penetrates a considerable way into the
earth, till it meets with <em>strata</em> resisting its farther
descent, and then that it flows along these like a river to far
distant countries. My explanation may be censured, but still on
reflection, I regard it as the most probable that I can<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> think of. There is another
interesting feature in Fezzan, namely, the constant formation of
salt on the surface of the sand. In travelling along, the different
stages of the process are very distinctly observable. First, a thin
crust is formed like hoar frost, and this continues to increase in
thickness. In some places the layer of salt is a foot deep. At
present I must defer the explanation of this phenomenon till I
shall have time to enter upon the description of the geological
structure of Fezzan—a thing I hope I shall soon be enabled to do.
In the mean time the courier is waiting, and the camels are ready
to convey us to Ghaat. My worthy friend Clapperton and I are just
on the point of setting out on a visit to that country, that we may
render our delay here as serviceable as possible. The Tuarick
country is, perhaps, interesting only on account of its
inhabitants, who are a brave, independent race. Clapperton and I
have been at Tucta, and we were both struck with the general
uniformity of the scenery and the structure. He desires to be
kindly remembered to you, and intends to write you soon. We expect
to be able to set out for Bornou in two or three months.”</p>

<p class="space-above15">The next letter in the series is addressed
to his sister, from “Mourzuk, August 6, 1822;” and though both it,
and the one which follows to Professor Jameson, relate to the
Doctor’s excursion to Ghaat, or the Tuarick country, of which an
account is given in the “Narrative<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_26">[26]</span> of Travels and Discoveries,” made by the
mission, published by Major D. Denham and Captain H. Clapperton, in
1826; yet, as they contain some interesting particulars which will
not be found in the “Narrative,” our readers, we trust, will thank
us for inserting them in this biographical memoir. In the letter to
his sister, he says,—</p>

<p>“My worthy friend Clapperton and I have been busily engaged ever
since our arrival here. Within the last two months we have been
travelling much, and have examined to the extent of at least 800
miles of country. We experienced little fatigue, and in place of
being weakened, our health has been greatly improved. We have been
among the Tuaricks, and have been treated by that independent and
curious people with the greatest kindness and hospitality. They
occupy all that dreary waste which you see in the maps called the
‘Great Sahara,’ and live on the milk and flesh of their camels. The
care of these animals, and occasional excursions upon the
neighbouring states, are their principal occupation. They are a
superstitious race; but have good sense withal. They were so much
our friends, that we might have travelled, in perfect safety, over
the whole of their dominions.”</p>

<h3 class="med"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>TO PROFESSOR
JAMESON.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Mourzuk, September 17</em>,
1822.</p>

<p>“When I wrote you last, I was just on the eve of departure for
the Tuarick country, and in about a fortnight from this date, I
hope we shall be on our way to Bornou. We found our journey to
Ghaat very pleasant, and our reception very flattering. We were
among a brave and warlike race, exceedingly superstitious; yet they
were sensible; and though remarkably strict Mahometans, yet liberal
in their ideas. The geology and botany of the country are nearly
the same as in Fezzan, which I cannot enter upon at present. We
made long excursions in the Wady (valley) Ghrurbi, and Wady Shiati,
which Captain Lyon incorrectly joins. In our course we examined the
Trona Lake, which is situated among amazingly high sand hills,
running for several hundreds of miles to the westward, and lie
between the Wadies Shiati and Ghrurbi. The lake is in a small
valley which runs nearly <span class="sc2">E.S.E.</span> and
<span class="sc2">W.N.W.</span> The north and south sides are
bounded by hills of sand about 400 feet high. The bottom of the
lake is a fine sand, on which is found the <em>cegoul</em>,
(apparently a species of silex) and a downy grass. Near the place
where we entered the valley there is a cluster of date palm trees,
and a small lake from which impure<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_28">[28]</span> Trona is obtained. On the western side is the
Trona lake, surrounded by date trees, and its banks covered, on
almost all sides, with the grass I have mentioned, and a tall
juncus. It is almost half a mile long, and nearly 200 yards wide,
of very inconsiderable depth at present (July) from the evaporation
of the water, and many places are now dry which are covered in the
winter and spring. The Trona is deposited in cakes at the bottom of
the lake when the water is sufficiently saturated. The cakes are of
various degrees of thickness, from a mere film to several inches.
The thickest I could find was not more than three quarters of an
inch, but at the beginning of the winter, when the water begins to
increase, it is of the thickness I have mentioned, and is then said
to be ripe. The surface next the bottom is not unequal from
crystallization, but rough to the feel on account of numerous
asperities. The upper surface is generally found studded with small
beautiful cubical crystals of muriate of soda; the line of junction
is always distinct, and one crystal is easily separated from
another; when not covered with the muriate of soda, this upper
surface is composed of a congeries of small tabular pieces, joined
in every position. When the mass is broken, there is a fine display
of circular crystals often radiated. The surface of the water is
covered in many places with large thin sheets of <em>carbo-muriate
of soda</em>, giving the whole the appearance of a lake
partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> frozen
over; film after film forms till the whole is a considerable
thickness. The soil of the lake is a dark barren sand approaching
to black, of a viscid consistence and strong smell; and on the
recently uncovered surface, near the banks, a black substance like
mineral tar is seen oozing out. The water begins to increase in the
winter, and in the spring it is at the <em>maximum</em>. The Trona
is best about the commencement of winter, but disappears entirely
in the spring.</p>

<p>“The lake has diminished in size within the last few years, and
if care be not taken, the diminution will soon be much greater.
Plants are making considerable encroachments, and very shallow
banks are observable in many places. On inquiry, we found the
quantity of Trona had not sensibly diminished during the last ten
years; but, perhaps, this may be owing to there being always easily
found a sufficient quantity of it to supply every demand. The
quantity annually exported amounts to between 400 or 500
camel-loads, each being 4 cwt.—a large quantity when the size of
the lake is considered. It is removed only when there is a demand.
Then a man wades into the lake, breaks off the Trona in large
sheets, which he easily does, and hands it to others outside, who
are ready to remove all foreign matters, and to pack it in the
retecious substance found on the leaves of the date tree. The water
of the valley is good, and if a well be dug in the very border of
the lake the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> is
also good, and nearly free from saline impregnation. There are a
great many springs in Wady Shiati, and a number in the wadies about
Ghaat. All of them, however, were so exposed, that it was
impossible to make any correct observations. The maximum heat of
Mourzuk is 105 Fah.—a great difference from that mentioned by
Captain Lyon. The greatest diurnal change is about 15 degrees—a
variation which is pretty regular. The hygrometer of Kater varies
from 360 to 410—an amazing small range. My worthy friend
Clapperton, sends his kind respects to you, and promises to write
you from Bornou. We enjoy the best health, and accomplished our
summer’s excursion without fatigue. Remember me kindly to Mr. P.
Niell, and tell him the Flora of Fezzan, and of the Tuarick country
is very poor; but that in a few months I expect to be on a soil
more congenial to the votaries of the fascinating goddess.”</p>

<h3 class="med">TO HIS SISTER.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Mourzuk, November 4</em>,
1822.</p>

<p>“It is now beginning to get very cold here, the mornings are
nearly as chilly as with you, so that we find it necessary to have
recourse to warm clothing. The people are really very obliging, but
they are great beggars. They are always asking for one thing or
another, and very frequently I feel it necessary to
reject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> their suit.
They are lively, and the lower orders are fond of dancing and
music. The dances are not like those in our country, and the
musical instruments and tunes are as rude and wild as is the
country to which they belong. How would you like to be locked up
always in the house and never allowed to go out, as are many of the
women here? The lower orders, indeed, are exempted, and they are
more happy than those who can boast of their rank. This place is
much more tolerant than many other Mahometan states; and we have
lived here as safely as we could have done in <em>Auld
Reekie</em>.”</p>

<h3 class="med">TO THE SAME.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Gatroni, December 5</em>,
1822.</p>

<p>“We have commenced our journey, and find travelling very
pleasant. We find it very cold, particularly in the mornings and
evenings—a circumstance which obliges us to wrap ourselves up the
same as in your northern regions. Our company is a very large one;
it consists of nearly 300 men, of whom 200 are Arabs sent for our
safety. I would have been better pleased to have had none, as the
road is free from danger, and the people no way to be dreaded. We
have never, thank God, had had any thing to fear—our path has been
smooth. With good conduct, I expect our dangers will be few, some
hardships must,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
doubtless, be encountered, but where can we be without them? The
people here are mostly Teboos, a different race from the natives of
Fezzan. Some of the women have very pretty countenances and a
lively expression. I have just been witnessing some of their
dances, which are really very chaste and pleasing. They want the
spirit of your reels, and resemble the movements of a minuet. There
is something smooth and sweet in the songs that always accompany
these performances, but the instrumental music is grating to the
ears. We leave this to-morrow; it is the joyful period we have long
looked forward to. We go under most propitious auspices, and all, I
trust, will be well.</p>

<h3 class="med">TO THE SAME.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Kuka, Kingdom of Bornou, April
2</em>, 1823.</p>

<p>“I dare say you begin to fear, but you have no reason, for we
are all as safe as you are. We arrived here a month ago, and were
received in the most flattering manner. Several thousand horsemen
were sent out to conduct us to town. The sheikh was very kind, and
has continued so ever since. He is the chief man; the sultan is
nothing. The climate is very hot, and the heat will continue till
the rains set in, which will not be for three months yet. The heat
at present is about the same as it is at the hottest season in
Fezzan. The inhabitants are two distinct races—the
black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> and the
copper-coloured. The former are Bornouese, and the latter are ———.
We have found them both very obliging. Our journey here was
pleasant, but it was over a dreary country. It yields no grass, and
the wells are several days’ journey from each other. Few animated
beings are to be seen in these deserts, and, unless for the
purposes of gain, they are shunned by man. I have been rather
unwell myself, but, thank God, I am now nearly well, and intend
setting out on an excursion through Bornou, in three or four days.
I had a slight fever and a troublesome cough which is now better.
In our excursion I do not expect to see much that is interesting,
as all the country we have passed over is much the same. There are
often thickets of trees with grass, which is all dried up. Near the
town there are many open spaces, on account of the trees having
been cut down for firewood. Near a great lake called Spad,
elephants, hippopotami, and antelopes are met with in great
numbers; my friend Clapperton has shot a great many of the latter.
He is quite an enthusiast in the chase, and has been very
successful. He enjoys the best of health, and is as stout as ever.
This is far from being a disagreeable country, but it is deficient
in fruit and vegetables—a circumstance we did not expect so far to
the southward, and which we feel as a great privation in a warm
climate. We have provisions in abundance, especially fowls and
sheep, the latter being very cheap,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_34">[34]</span>—40<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for a dollar—a vast
difference from what you must pay for your mutton. Still there is
not that comfort in living here that you experience; and although
you must pay more for some of the articles you use, yet, perhaps,
you live cheaper than we can. There are no great beauties among the
females of this place, yet many of them have pleasing countenances.
All of them have their hair done up in a peculiar manner, which
must require great patience and labour. They have among them four
or five different fashions, each however adheres to her own, and it
serves to distinguish the town to which she belongs, and the race
from which she is descended; and so these African fashions may have
continued many generations without change. It is quite a different
thing with your fashionables, who must have something new every
month. The dress is very simple, being merely a piece of blue
calico, which comes up nearly to the shoulders, and a similar
portion that passes over the head. Beads are a common ornament; you
do not see a single female without them, and the rich have broad
girdles, which they take care every now and then to show.</p>

<h3 class="med">TO THE SAME.</h3>

<p class="right pad-right2">“<em>Kuka, July 14</em>, 1823.</p>

<p>“Since I wrote you last I have got very little new to
communicate. But you will be glad<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_35">[35]</span> to hear that my health is now much improved.
I have been travelling about during the last six weeks, for the
purpose of visiting the different places of importance; and I have
reason to be well pleased with the treatment I have everywhere
experienced; all have been civil—kind. There is indeed very little
left for me to desire, every thing having so far exceeded my
expectations. The sheikh Canmi, governor of Bornou, has been like a
father, granting every indulgence, and showing every kindness. At
the end of the rains I hope to go into Soudan, to make discoveries
there, the people are good, and the country very interesting. Our
houses are not waterproof like yours. They are little round places
of mud with straw roofs. There are neither stones nor lime in the
whole kingdom, so that large substantial houses cannot be built for
want of materials. The streets are frequently knee-deep with water
from the rain of a few hours. The thunder is awful, but the
lightning seldom does any damage. There are very few poisonous
animals, and noxious insects are very rare. I think, if every thing
turns out as I expect, I shall be home in little more than a year.
I have nothing to dread, and have never had a wakeful night from
fear.”</p>

<p class="space-above15">It would be an easy matter for a severe
critic to point out many incorrect expressions in these letters, as
it is obvious they were all written off-hand amid the hurry and
anxiety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> of the
avocations connected with the mission, and certainly never meant to
meet the public eye. But, we think, they cannot be perused without
producing a deep impression that their author was devotedly
attentive to the performance of his public duties—that he possessed
a sanguine temperament and a well-informed mind—and that his heart
was actuated by a sense of the obligations of friendship, and the
kindly feeling of fraternal affection. With regard to this latter
sentiment, indeed, it is quite clear, from that portion of the
letters to his sister which—as relating entirely to private and
confidential matters—has been suppressed, that his anxiety for the
welfare of his relatives was never absent from his thoughts, and
that the desire to afford them protection, and to minister to their
comfort, was the constant and powerful stimulant to his exertions.
The substance of the second of his letters to professor Jameson was
printed in the volume published by Denham and Clapperton, giving an
account of the result of the mission in which they, along with Dr.
Oudney, had been sent. The first letter to the professor, however,
contains original matter, as well as the most of those to his
sister; and had he lived to return home, and reduce his
<em>memoranda</em> to a state fit for publication, we have reason
to believe that he would have greatly enlarged our knowledge of
Africa. The Doctor and Clapperton set out towards Soudan about the
middle of December 1823, while Major Denham<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_37">[37]</span> went on an exploratory excursion in
another direction; and while engaged in its prosecution, he
received a short note from Dr. Oudney. It was brought from Katagum.
“It had no date, and was indeed his last effort. The acknowledgment
of being weak and helpless,” says Major D., “assured me that he was
really so; for, during the whole of his long sufferings, a
complaint had scarcely ever escaped his lips. On the Shiekh’s
saying to him, when he first expressed his wish to accompany the
<em>Kafila</em>, ‘surely your health is not such as to risk such a
journey?’ he merely replied, ‘why, if I stay here I shall die, and
probably sooner, as travelling always improves my health.’ This
letter, though short, expresses great satisfaction at the treatment
he had met with on his journey, and also from the inhabitants of
the country.”<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> Captain Clapperton’s letter to Mr. Consul
Warrington, dated Kano, 2d February, 1824, contains the last scene
of this mournful history.</p>

<p>“The melancholy task has fallen to me to report to you the
lamented death of my friend Dr. Walter Oudney. We left Kuka on the
14th day of December 1823, and by easy journies arrived at
Bedukarfea, the westmost town in the kingdom of Bornou; during this
part of the journey, he was recovering strength very fast, but on
leaving Bedukarfea and entering the Beder territory on the night of
the 26th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> and morning
of the 27th, we had such an intense cold that the water was frozen
in the dishes, and the water-skins were as hard as beards. Here the
poor Doctor got a severe cold, and continued to grow weaker every
day. At this time he told me that when he left Kuka, he expected
his disorder would allow him to perform all his country expected of
him, but that now his death was near, and required me to deliver
his papers to Lord Bathurst, and to say he wished Mr. Barrow might
have the arrangement of them, if agreeable to his Lordship. On the
2d of January, 1824, we arrived at the city of Katagum, where we
remained till the 10th, partly to see if the Doctor, by staying a
few days, would gain a little strength to enable him to pursue his
journey. On leaving Katagum he rode a camel as he was too weak to
ride his horse. We proceeded on our road for ten miles that day,
and then halted; and, on the following day five miles further, to a
town called Murmur. On the morning of the 12th, he ordered the
camels to be loaded at day-light, drank a cup of coffee, and I
assisted him to dress. When the camels were loaded, with the
assistance of his servant and I, he came out of the tent. I saw
then that the hand of death was upon him, and that he had not an
hour to live. I begged him to return to his tent and lay himself
down, which he did, and I sat down beside him; he expired in about
half an hour after.</p>

<p>“I sent immediately to the governor of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_39">[39]</span> town to acquaint him with what had
happened, and to desire he would point out a spot where I might
bury my friend, and also to have people to watch the body and dig
the grave, which was speedily complied with. I had dead cloths made
from some turbans that were intended as presents, and as we
travelled as Englishmen and servants of his Majesty, I considered
it my most indispensable duty to read the service of the dead over
the grave, according to the rites of the Church of England, which
happily was not objected to, but, on the contrary, I was paid a
good deal of respect for so doing. I then bought two sheep, which
were killed and given to the poor, and I had a clay wall built
round the grave, to preserve it from beasts of prey.” It is added
to this account (inserted in the “Narrative,” &amp;c.) of the death
and funeral, substantially the same as that given above, that “Thus
died Walter Oudney, M.D., a man of unassuming deportment, pleasing
manners, stedfast perseverance, and undaunted enterprise; while his
mind was fraught at once with knowledge, virtue, and religion,”—a
statement which accurately describes his character. In personal
appearance, we may remark, that in stature he was of the middle
size, slightly made, with a pale complexion, and grave and
benevolent expression of countenance.</p>

<p>It will naturally be asked—since Dr. Oudney was of a temper of
mind so active and enterprising, as well as possessed of so
much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> physical
science—why he has contributed so little to the elucidation of the
central parts of Africa which he visited? We are sorry we are
unable to solve this problem, having found it impossible to obtain
any farther information on the subject than is contained in the
volume of Travels, published (1826) in the name of the three
persons who formed the mission, namely, Denham, Clapperton, and
Oudney. Denham, in speaking of the materials of the volume in
question says, that the only papers of Oudney’s placed in his
hands, were “an itinerary from Mourzuk to Bornou,” and “An
excursion to the westward of Mourzuk.” The latter is printed at the
end of the “Introductory Chapter;” but of the former, only a few
mineralogical notes are given. There is not a doubt, however, but
that a vast mass of materials illustrative of the districts
visited, were collected by Dr. Oudney, although it is now
impossible to say what has become of them. Mr. Barrow asserts that
he was labouring under a pectoral complaint when he left England;
and that the disorder was increased by this journey to Ghaat, and
he would thereby insinuate that, during the greater part of the
time he lived in Africa, he was rendered unfit, by bodily weakness,
for keeping regular journals. Now, none of his most intimate
friends had the least suspicion that he was troubled with any
disease of the breast. His chest, instead of being contracted, was
broad and ample; and, in ascending<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_41">[41]</span> the hills of his native land, and the equally
difficult common stairs of Edinburgh, the lightness of his figure,
and the activity of his habits, always enabled him to outrun the
longest-winded, and the supplest-jointed of his companions; and
certainly nothing mentioned in the letters which we have published
would lead to the inference that he did not enjoy the most perfect
health till after he had been a considerable length of time in
Bornou. It is likewise quite clear that he was not of a character
to neglect any duty which the situation in which he was placed
imposed upon him; and so we repeat, that a great deal of valuable
information must have been collected by him, although it is to be
feared it is now irrecoverably lost. It is to be regretted,
moreover, that his premature death rendered the term of his service
too short to warrant government to make some provision for his
sisters, now orphans, and one of them in a bad state of health.</p>

<h3>Section I.—<span class="med">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</span></h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> life of Captain Hugh
Clapperton, who died in his second attempt to explore the interior
of Africa, was short, but very eventful. Not only did he possess a
frame and constitution, both of body and mind, well fitted for a
career of active exertion and romantic enterprise; but from the day
of his birth to that of his death, it was his lot to endure, with
almost no interruption, a painful succession of hardships and
privations, or to be engaged in scenes and pursuits of a nature so
perilous as to put existence itself in constant and imminent
jeopardy. And had any record of these things been kept, either by
himself or by any one else, who might chance to know even a tithe
of the manifold dangers to which he was exposed, and the bold, and
sometimes rash enterprises in which he was engaged, a narrative
might thence have been composed, all<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_46">[46]</span> true to the letter, and yet as full of
wonderful and diversified incident, as well as of fearless and
daring action, as ever flowed from the pen of the most creative
genius in fictitious history—all modified by the child-like
simplicity and generous nobleness of heart, combined with unbending
integrity, unshrinking courage, and indomitable fortitude, in the
character of him, whose fortunes in life they formed, and whose
achievements in the discharge of duty they exhibited. But no such
record was kept, except, while he lived, in our hero’s own
retentive memory; and therefore, now that he is dead, some of the
most marvellous passages of his life must remain in the deep
oblivion in which they have been buried. We are assured by the
friends with whom he lived in the closest intimacy, that when, like
Othello, he was questioned respecting the story of his life from
year to year; the battles, sieges, fortunes, that he had past; he
would, with a fine flow of good humour, and an interesting detail
of particulars, run it through even from his boyish days, down to
the time when he was desired to tell it; and then, like the
enamoured Moor, it was his hint to speak of most disastrous
chances,</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Of moving accidents by flood or

<div class="line indent0">Of hair-breadth ’scapes in the imminent

<div class="line indent0">With all his travel’s history.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>But these
narratives of his adventures were given by Clapperton for the sole
end of entertaining his friends when they met for the mere purpose
of social intercourse and convivial enjoyment; and, therefore,
those friends can now give but a very indistinct account of what
“by parcels they had something heard,” without any intention of
detailing it again, unless in the same way and for the same purpose
it had been told to themselves. Hence the early and professional
life of our traveller can never be well known, except that part of
it which he has embodied in the published journals of his
expeditions to Africa. And not only are the incidents of his life
during the time he was a sailor imperfectly known, but even of
those parts of it respecting which we have obtained some vague
information, we have different versions of the same story
considerably at variance with one another; so that, amid their
discrepancy, it is difficult to select the facts and circumstances
relative to the life of our hero which are genuine and free from
defect on the one side, and exaggeration on the other. No memoir of
his life has yet appeared at all worthy of him. We have seen in one
periodical an atrocious libel upon his memory, the emanation
evidently of a mean and malignant spirit. Any newspaper notices of
him which have been printed are meagre in the extreme; and the
“Short Sketch” which is prefixed to the “Journal of his Second
Expedition,” and purporting to be the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_48">[48]</span> work of his uncle, a colonel of marines,
although the best account of him which has yet appeared, contains
exceedingly little that is really interesting. Such being the lack
of materials, we regret much that we shall not be able to produce a
“Memoir” adequate to the subject; but we can assure our readers
that we have used all diligence to obtain the most accurate and
ample information which can now be had, and shall therefore proceed
to submit it to their candid consideration.</p>

<h3>Sect. II.—<span class="med">HIS PARENTAGE AND EARLY MISFORTUNES.</span></h3>

<p>In one of the short notices which have been published of the
traveller’s life, it is stated that the “family of Clapperton is
ancient, and not without celebrity in the north of Scotland. The
name,” it is added, “has been distinguished both in the church and
in the field; and in proof of this we are told that a Bishop
Clapperton is buried in the island called Inchcolm, in the Firth of
Forth; while another individual of the same name is mentioned in
the history of Sweden as having been a field-marshall in the army
of that country. We cannot tell whether the prelate or the soldier
is to be regarded as belonging to the family whence the African
traveller was descended; but it unquestionably was highly
respectable, both in point of antiquity and of its station
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> society. His
grandfather, Robert Clapperton, was a doctor of medicine, whose
professional studies were pursued by him first at the University of
Edinburgh, and afterwards among the hospitals in Paris. On his
return to his own country he married Miss Elizabeth Campbell, a
near relation of Campbell of Glenlyon, and settled at the town of
Lochmaben, in Dumfries-shire, as a medical practitioner. He is said
to have been a good classical scholar, and much attached to the
study of antiquity; and while he excelled in the tracing of
genealogies, in the collecting of coins and songs, with the view of
illustrating border history, he was highly esteemed as a skilful
physician. He had two sons, the younger of whom chose the army as
his profession, and is now a lieutenant-colonel of marines; but
George, the elder of the two, adopted that of his father; and
having previously obtained an adequate professional education, he
settled as a surgeon in the town of Annan, Dumfries-shire. He was
long the only medical practitioner of repute in that place; and the
numerous operations and cures which he performed proved the means
both of increasing his practice and extending his fame. While still
young, he married a daughter of Johnstone of Thornythwaite, by whom
he had fourteen children, Hugh, who afterwards became the African
traveller, being the tenth. The mother of this numerous family, who
is described as beautiful, amiable and accomplished,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> died in the thirty-ninth year of
her age, leaving behind her seven sons and a daughter, Hugh being
the youngest of these surviving sons, and consequently a mere
infant. And to enhance the greatness of the bereavement which he
had sustained in the loss of his mother, his father speedily
afterwards married a second wife, whom his friends regarded as a
woman of inferior station to that which he and his family occupied.
At the time when this second marriage took place, most of the sons
had left their father’s house, to engage elsewhere in the active
pursuits of life, and the girl had been taken away by her mother’s
relations; but the subject of this memoir and some of his younger
brothers, were left at home to encounter the stern control of a
stepmother—a species of government at best far from being
desirable, but in the case of the young Clappertons, rendered
peculiarly arbitrary and despotic, from the concurrence of a
variety of incidental circumstances. In the first place, their
stepmother, conscious that she was deemed by the friends of the
family an unsuitable match for their father, must have been haunted
incessantly by a feeling, not at all likely to soothe and sweeten
her temper, or fitted to dispose her to regard the children of the
former marriage with any considerable degree of complacency; by a
feeling not likely to lead her to watch over such of them as were
subject to her management with any very vigilant
attention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> to make
her extremely solicitous about their comfort or improvement, or to
visit them with a treatment any way marked by kind and tender
affection. In the second place, she soon had children of her own,
and these, by degrees, increased, till they amounted to the number
of seven; and it will readily be allowed, that her own offspring
were naturally fitted more strongly to engage her affections and to
engross her solicitude, than those children with whom she had only
an adventitious relationship. And in the third place, it would
appear that Dr. Clapperton himself, the father of the African
traveller, was not by any means so attentive to the interests of
his immense family as he ought to have been; for his brother, the
colonel, says of him, “He might have made a fortune, but
unfortunately he was, like his father, careless of money;” and we
believe the fact cannot be denied; nor, moreover, can it be
disguised that the condition into which he fell in his latter days
was owing, partly at least, to a culpable neglect of his
professional duties.<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When, therefore, it is considered that as
his father advanced in years, his circumstances in life so much
declined, as at last to reduce him into a state of abject
indigence,—while at the same time his family was constantly
increasing in number, and that it was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_52">[52]</span> the melancholy lot of our traveller to lose
his mother in his infancy, and so scarcely ever to have had the
happiness to experience the soothing and heart-impressive influence
of maternal tenderness and maternal care, but, on the contrary, to
be placed at that tender age under the care and control of a
stepmother,—it will be abundantly obvious that his life commenced
under the most unpropitious auspices that can well be imagined.</p>

<h3>Sect. III.—<span class="med">HIS BIRTH, EDUCATION, AND YOUTHFUL ADVENTURES.</span></h3>

<p>He was born in the year 1788, and was, as we have seen, soon
after placed under the charge of a stepmother, by whom it is said
he was not only neglected, but treated with harshness and cruelty;
and hence throughout his life stepmothers were regarded by him with
a feeling of unconquerable horror.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The accounts which he
occasionally gave his companions of the sufferings of his youth,
arising from the causes which have been specified, were appalling.
In reference to them, an enemy, who, however, seems to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> have been in possession of
accurate information on the subject, says, that while a schoolboy,
“the climate of Lapland and that of Timbuctoo alternated several
times in the course of a day—a species of seasoning, or rather
<em>case-hardening</em>, that must go far to render him
invulnerable on the sultry banks of the Joliba.” And one of the
most intimate of his friends thus speaks of them in a letter now
before us: “How can the hardships and privations of his early life
be touched upon without hurting the feelings of relatives? These
had much better be buried in oblivion, although they tended to form
the man hardy and self-denying.” When he was a boy, he was nearly
drowned in the Annan; and on that occasion he used to say, that he
felt as if a calm and pleasing sleep was stealing over his senses,
and thought that gay and beautifully painted streamers were
attached to his legs and arms, and that thereby he was buoyed out
into the sea; but he always declared that he experienced no pain
until efforts were making to restore him to a state of animation.
At this time he was an expert swimmer, having been previously
taught that useful art by his brothers; but he had exhausted his
strength by continuing too long in the water. When the alarm of his
danger was given by some one to his father, he hastened to the
spot, plunged in, and found his son in a sitting posture in very
deep water.</p>

<p>Among the injuries of his early life, that of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> a neglected education was none
of the least. He was taught the ordinary acquirements of reading,
writing, and arithmetic, which are generally imparted to the lowest
classes of the Scottish youth; but he was never initiated into a
knowledge of the classic authors of Greece and Rome. Under Mr.
Bryce Downie, however, a celebrated teacher of geometry in the town
of Annan, he acquired a practical knowledge of mathematics,
including navigation and trigonometry, and afterwards, by means of
his own application, he acquired many other branches of useful and
ornamental knowledge, and excelled especially in drawing.<a id=
"FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>He very early discovered a strong propensity for this latter
accomplishment, so that, with the aid of a few instructions from
his father, who excelled in the knowledge of geography, he could
sketch a map of Europe,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_55">[55]</span> while still a child in frocks, with chalk on
the floor. His love of foreign travel and romantic adventure, were
likewise very soon manifested in the delight which he took in
listening to his father, while he pointed out the likely situation
of the “North West passage” to him and his brothers on the globe;
in the enthusiasm which he displayed, when told by his father that
he might be the destined discoverer of that long sought for route
from Europe to Eastern Asia; and also in the avidity with which he
devoured books of voyages and travels of all descriptions whenever
they fell in his way.</p>

<p>The circumstance of his entering upon a seafaring life is
variously reported. By one account we are assured that his
situation at home being so unpleasant, he became so thoroughly
disgusted with his father’s house, that he left it clandestinely,
and went on board the first vessel in the harbour of Annan that was
willing to receive him. By his anonymous and unfriendly biographer,
it is said that he was promoted to the rank of an apprentice to a
coasting sloop of Maryport, commanded by Captain John Smith, and
that soon afterwards he was again promoted to the rank of cook’s
mate on board his majesty’s tender in the harbour of Liverpool. His
uncle’s account, in the sketch of his life prefixed to the Journal
of his Second African Expedition, is, that on leaving Mr. Downie,
at the age of thirteen, he was, by his own desire, bound
an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> apprentice to the
owner of a vessel of considerable burden trading between Liverpool
and North America: that after making several voyages in that
vessel, he either left her or was impressed into his Majesty’s
service, and put on board the tender lying at Liverpool. It is
clear, from all these accounts, that Captain Clapperton commenced
his naval career as a common sailor boy—a situation which implies
hard duty and rough usage; yet, as is testified by the following
well authenticated anecdote, this, with all he had previously
endured, was unable to break his spirit, or to subdue the dignified
feelings of a noble nature. As soon as he had joined the trading
vessel in which he first sailed, he was told that one piece of duty
which he had to perform on board was to brush his captain’s boots
and shoes. This he positively refused to do, adding, that he was
most willing to take his full share of the hardest work which
belonged to the loading, the unloading, or the working of the ship;
but to the menial drudgery of cleaning boots and shoes he certainly
would not submit. After he had for a short time served on board
several trading vessels, he was impressed into his Majesty’s
service at Liverpool; and in 1806 he was sent to Gibraltar in a
navy transport.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a> The idea, however,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_57">[57]</span> of having been placed on board a man-of-war
by force, and retained there as a prisoner, was so galling to his
nature—to a spirit panting and struggling to be free—that he formed
the resolution (one most difficult to be put in practice) of
deserting whenever the opportunity of doing so should occur: and
such was the reckless daring of his disposition, that, watching the
time when he was least observed by his messmates before the mast,
he actually threw himself headlong overboard, and swam towards a
Gibraltar privateer—a vessel of that class which, during the late
war, were usually called <em>rock scorpions</em> by our sailors. He
was taken on board the privateer, and so for a short time he was
the associate of an abandoned and a lawless set of robbers. But he
was soon disgusted with their regardless,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_58">[58]</span> savage and brutal manners, and so embraced
the first opportunity of leaving them, and of going again into the
merchant service. While, however, he was on board the Rock
Scorpion, she had sustained an engagement, in which our hero was
severely wounded by a grape-shot—an accident by which his body was
seamed and scarred in a frightful manner, and which, had it
happened to his face or his limbs, must have rendered him deformed
or lame for life.</p>

<h3 class="hang1">Sect. IV.—<span class="med">THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WAS PROMOTED TO
THE RANK OF A MIDSHIPMAN IN THE ROYAL NAVY.</span></h3>

<p>After he had left the privateer he was soon discovered, and
brought back to the Renommée frigate as a deserter. It is mentioned
in the “Sketch,” which says nothing of the rock scorpion adventure,
that when Clapperton first joined the Renommée frigate, which was
commanded by Sir Thomas Livingstone, having heard that his uncle, a
captain of marines on board his Majesty’s ship Saturn, which had
arrived at Gibraltar for the purpose of watering and refitting, he
sent him a letter describing his situation on board the Renommée;
that his uncle having previously been a messmate of her captain,
Sir Thomas Livingstone, interfered with him in behalf
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> his nephew, and
through his interest got him promoted to the rank of a
midshipman.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> All we can say to this statement is, that
Clapperton himself, whose heart was most grateful, never spoke of a
letter he had written to his uncle, nor that he was in any way
indebted to that gentleman for his promotion in the navy. He seems
never to have seen his uncle till he met him in London after he had
engaged to go with Dr. Oudney to Africa. In a letter to a friend,
dated London, 1st September 1821, he says, “my uncle has been to
see me several times, and was truly kind. He is a perfect
gentleman, without any nonsense.” Now, the correspondent to whom he
thus writes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> declares
that Clapperton never mentioned to him that he had ever written to
his uncle, soliciting his interest in his favour, or that he was in
any respect indebted to him, in the first instance, for his
promotion in the navy. But while he said nothing to his friend of
his uncle in connexion with this matter, he frequently gave him a
most circumstantial and graphic description of the manner in which
this promotion took place. And as it is in keeping with the rest of
the romantic and eventful life of our hero, and, above all, as it
is his own account, we hasten to lay it before our readers.</p>

<p>When he was apprehended as a deserter, and brought back to his
old birth on board the Renommée, his captain, Sir Thomas
Livingstone, having previously observed that he possessed a
strength of body, a robustness of constitution, and a fearless
daringness of spirit, which might be turned to good account in the
naval service, which, at that time required to be sustained and
strengthened by attaching to it men of such mental and bodily
qualities as these, asked the deserter, if he should pardon his
delinquency, and raise him to the rank of a midshipman, would he
give him his solemn pledge, that he would no more desert, but do
his duty faithfully? Clapperton, with the bold and dauntless air
and bearing of the captive British prince, who “had been the
admiration, the terror of the Romans,” when led in triumph through
the streets of the mighty capital, still “walked the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> warrior, majestic in his
chains,” replied that he was not yet prepared to give a final and
decisive answer to such a question, and therefore asked time to
consider on what he should determine. “Are you not aware, Sir,”
rejoined the captain, “that I can order you to be flogged as a
deserter?” “That I know you can do, and I expect no less,” was our
hero’s reply, “but still I am unprepared at present to decide on
your proposal.” The result, however, of this extraordinary
conversation was, that the captain ordered him into solitary
confinement, with an admonition to lose no time in coming to a
speedy determination as to the course which he should adopt. In
this situation his reflections took a wise and a prudent turn, and
led him quickly to resolve to give his generous captain the
assurance of fidelity which he required of him; and, on doing so,
he was promoted to the rank of a midshipman on board the Renommée
frigate, where he had first served as an impressed sailor boy, and
on the deck of which he had stood in the capacity of an apprehended
deserter. Afterwards, on his own request, he was allowed to go on
shore during a specified period of time, on his <em>parole</em> of
honour. It is very true the account of his promotion through his
uncle’s interference in his behalf accords better with the ordinary
course of things in such proceedings than that stated above. But we
think, that if Clapperton had been aware that he was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> indebted to his uncle on this
occasion he would not have concealed the fact from his friends; and
likewise we think, that the disparity of his condition as a common
sailor, and that of his uncle as a captain of marines, would have
been sufficient to deter him from making himself known to his
uncle, or asking any thing from him. For though his feelings of
honour sometimes rested on mistaken principles, they were always
very sensitive; and so we are decidedly of opinion, that in the
circumstances of this case he would have felt equally unwilling to
expose his own servile condition to his uncle, and to compromise
his uncle’s dignity by making the captain of marines appear the
near kinsman of the common sailor. We happen to know a case in
point which illustrates this view of the matter. During the late
war, one of the sons of a gentleman in Argyleshire, absconded from
his father’s house, and for a while it was unknown where he had
gone, till he was discovered by one of his brothers, a captain in
the army, as a common sailor on board a man-of-war. The captain
instigated by fraternal affection, was anxious to procure an
interview with his brother, and so sent him a note, informing him
where he was, and expressing his earnest desire that he would
endeavour to meet him on shore. The answer to this kind and
brotherly invitation was an expression of wounded pride. “If,” said
the sailor, “Captain M. has any business to transact with Donald M.
let him come on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> board
H. M. S——— and transact it there.” And we think Clapperton would
have been apt to feel and act nearly in the same manner in the
circumstances in which he and his uncle were relatively situated on
board the Renommée frigate, and the ship Saturn; though at the same
time, it is not unlikely that Sir Thomas Livingstone having
discovered his deserter’s connexion with his old messmate, was
disposed not only to remit his punishment, but likewise to give him
the chance of retrieving his honour and of benefiting his country.
Neither do we think it is the least unlikely that Sir Thomas and
Captain Clapperton may have had mutual communications respecting
our hero, but we can see no reason for believing that he was in any
way made privy to them, but many to make us believe the contrary.
Now raised to the rank of a midshipman, he performed some hard
service on the coast of Spain, in which he was wounded on the
head—a wound which, though it seemed apparently slight, afterwards
gave him much annoyance. He remained on board the Renommée, and
under the command of Sir Thomas Livingstone, to whom he was so
deeply indebted, till the year 1808, when the frigate was brought
to England and paid off.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Sect. V.—<span class="med">HIS
SERVICE IN THE EAST INDIES.</span></h3>

<p>When Clapperton left the Renommée frigate, and his generous
captain, Sir Thomas Livingstone, to whom he was indebted for his
first step of promotion in the Royal Navy, he is said to have
joined his Majesty’s ship Venerable, (or, as others say, the San
Domingo,) which then lay in the Downs under the command of Captain
King. But as this was a situation too monotonous and inactive for
his enterprising spirit, he volunteered to go with Captain Briggs,
to the East Indies, in the Clorinde frigate. Though, however, his
services were accepted, he could not obtain his discharge in time
to make his voyage to India in the Clorinde; and so he was deprived
of the pleasure of getting acquainted, in the course of it, with
those with whom he was ultimately<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> to be associated as his messmates. But as
tranships and convoys were frequently sailing from England to the
east, he was ordered by the Admiral to have a passage on board one
of them, and to join Captain Briggs on his arrival in India.</p>

<p>In the course of this outward voyage, he was ordered, during the
raging of a tremendous storm, to go, in an open barge, to the
relief of a vessel in distress. The barge was accordingly manned,
but the mighty rolling of the billows chaffed and vexed with the
furious raging of the tempest, was such, that Clapperton and many
others on board the ship in which he sailed, were of opinion, that
it was next to impossible an open boat could live during the
blowing of so heavy a gale. In this emergency, Clapperton said,
that it was not for him to dispute the orders of his superior
officer, but that he was thoroughly convinced that in doing his
duty he must sacrifice his life. Then, in serious mood and
sailor-like fashion, he made his will, bequeathing any little
property he had among his messmates—his kit to one, his quadrant to
another, and his glass and watch to a third—adding, that in all
probability they should never meet again, and requesting them to
keep these articles, trifling as they were, in token of his
affection for them. Then he jumped into the barge, which, in spite
of all that the most skillful seamanship could accomplish, had
scarcely left the side of the ship, when she was upset,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> the greater part
of her crew engulfed in the awfully agitated waters. Clapperton,
however, and a few other individuals, still clung to the sides of
the floating wreck; and though their perilous situation was
distinctly seen from the ship, no assistance could be afforded to
them, so long as the tempest continued to rage with so much
violence. In the mean time, Clapperton, while he was careful to
preserve his own life, did his utmost, and more than perhaps any
other man would have ventured to do in like circumstances, to save
the lives of his companions in distress. As they, one by one, lost
their hold of the barge, and dropped off into the sea, he swam
after them, picked them up, and replaced them in their former
situation. He was especially anxious to save the life of a warrant
officer, the boatswain of the ship, we believe. This man he several
times rescued when he was on the point of sinking, and restored him
to the barge. By these efforts, Clapperton’s strength, great as it
was, soon became nearly exhausted, and while with difficulty he was
bringing the boatswain back to take a fresh hold of the boat, and
while at the same time he was crying, “Oh, what will become of my
wife and children,” Clapperton coolly observed, that he had better
pay some attention to his own safety at present, otherwise he must,
however reluctantly, leave him to his fate. This man was drowned,
as well as every one else who had left the ship in the barge,
except Clapperton and the bowman,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_67">[67]</span> whom our hero cheered by saying, “Thank
heaven neither you nor I is the Jonah,” intimating, by this marine
proverb, that it was not for the punishment of their bad conduct
that the tempest had been sent; and at the same time advised him to
<em>bob</em>, that is, to lay himself flat, when he saw a wave
approaching, so that he might not be washed off the barge.</p>

<p>Long prior to this signal occurrence, in which our hero showed
so much of the boldness of determined courage, united with the
gentle feelings of compassion, he had become a general favourite
both with the officers and men. His stately form, his noble
bearing, his kind, frank, and manly demeanour, had endeared him to
all on board the ship in which he served. But a man is often the
last to know the sentiments entertained of him by others to whom he
is known; and indeed, seldom knows them at all, unless when they
happen to be revealed to him by accidental circumstances. And
hence, as Clapperton was hoisted on board the ship, in an exhausted
state, after being rescued from the perilous situation in which he
had so long struggled for his life, he had his feelings strongly
excited, on hearing the wives of the Scottish soldiers on board
exclaiming, “Thank heaven, it is na our ain kintryman, the bonny
muckle midshipman that’s drownded after a’!”</p>

<p>It may reasonably be supposed, that the gallantry and humanity
which Clapperton had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
so conspicuously displayed on this trying occasion, would tend to
deepen the esteem in which he was held by all on board, and
especially that it would be the means of securing for him the
admiration, the affection, and the friendship of many kindred
spirits connected with the navy—a service so long and so eminently
distinguished for firmness of purpose and nobleness of disposition.
Accordingly, when Clapperton arrived in India, and when his
gallantry was made known, he received the greatest attention from
Captain Briggs,<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> during the whole of the time he continued under
his command; and among other friendships which he formed with
officers of his own standing, was one of peculiar intimacy and
tenderness, with Mr. Mackenzie, the youngest son of the late Lord
Seaforth. It happened that this amiable and noble youth became, in
that distant region, the victim of a dangerous disease; and during
the whole of his illness, Clapperton, his newly acquired friend,
unless when the avocations of professional duty called him hence,
never left him; but continued to amuse and nurse him with the
affectionate assiduity of a loving brother, till he was so far
recovered as to be able to resume his public duty. After Mackenzie
was in some degree restored to health, he continued<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> to be depressed in spirits, and
in that state became careless of his person and of every thing
else, thinking, like most hypochondriacs, that death was fast
approaching to deliver him from all his sufferings. When under the
influence of these feelings—afflicted indeed both in mind and
body—he was by no means a desirable companion, and in truth was
shunned by most of the young officers on board the Clorinde. But
Clapperton, whose benevolent heart would not permit him to witness
a fellow-creature, and still less a countryman and a friend an
object of unfeeling neglect, redoubled his attentions to the
forlorn youth. He read with him daily such books of instruction and
amusement as either of them had in their possession, or could
procure the perusal of from the other officers. He endeavoured to
inspire him with the sentiments befitting his rank as the lineal
descendant of a noble family, and with a sense of the duties
incumbent upon him as an officer of the British navy. He talked to
him of Scotland, and relations, and home. He entertained him with
amusing anecdotes, of which he possessed an inexhaustible fund, and
by relating to him the numerous vicissitudes and strange adventures
of his own early life. And such was the happy effect produced upon
the health and spirits of his young friend, that he was able to
resume his duty on board the Clorinde, and to enjoy and return the
cordial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> friendship
which he experienced from Clapperton.</p>

<p>Though we believe, that the officers of the British navy are,
perhaps, more distinguished for simplicity of feeling and openness
of heart, than the men belonging to any other profession
whatsoever; yet, it would appear, that some of the officers of the
Clorinde had given entertainment in their breasts to the green-eyed
monster, Envy. And hence, when they observed the close intimacy
which subsisted between Clapperton and Mackenzie, and the kind
attention which, during his illness, the latter experienced from
the former, they said among themselves, but loud enough to be heard
by Clapperton, “The canny Scotsman knows what he is about, by
attaching himself so closely to a sprig of nobility; he courts his
favour that he may use him as his instrument for obtaining
promotion.” The effect of these injurious whisperings upon the mind
of our hero was, in the first instance, to cause him to make a
great sacrifice of feeling to the injury both of himself and his
friend. He withdrew all attention from Mackenzie, and ceased, not
only to keep company with him, but even to speak to him when they
met. Mackenzie, in utter ignorance as to the cause of the change
which had so suddenly taken place in the conduct of Clapperton
towards him, after having puzzled and perplexed his mind in
conjecturing in what way he had given such deadly
offence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> to his
friend, as to make him behave in the manner he was doing, at last
mustered courage, fairly to ask him, why he had of late treated him
with so much coldness and distance? On this, Clapperton, with his
feelings strongly excited, stated to his friend what had been said
among their shipmates, of the interested motives which had been
attributed to him, as the cause of what they had represented as
pretended friendship on his part. “But,” he added, “my dear
Mackenzie, I have been wrong to punish both myself and you, in
listening to these most false and injurious speeches. And
henceforth let the best of them beware how they use them in future;
for the first man whom I detect doing so, must do it at the risk of
his life.” As this hint was pretty publicly intimated on the part
of Clapperton, his friendship for Mackenzie suffered no
interruption afterwards, so long as they served together in the
same ship. But the disease which he had caught returned upon him
again, and after causing him to linger for some time as an invalid,
he was sent to his friends, with little hope of his recovery; nor
indeed had he been long at home, till he died. While, however, he
lay upon his death-bed, he spoke with all the enthusiasm of sincere
and warm friendship, of the kind attentions he had received from
Clapperton when ill and far from home; and entreated his relations,
and especially his mother, to discharge the debt of gratitude which
he owed him, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
treating him as a son, in requital of his having, so long as he had
it in his power, treated him as his brother.</p>

<p>We have not been able to obtain any satisfactory information
respecting the nature of the naval service in which Clapperton was
employed in India, nor of the exploits of seamanship and prowess
which he performed while he was on that station, except in one
instance, which is well worthy of being recorded to his honour.
When we stormed Port Louis, in the Isle of France, he was the first
man who advanced into the breach; and it was he who pulled down the
colours of France, and planted those of Britain in their place. And
we know that his conduct was in all respects worthy of the rank
which he had obtained in a manner so unique, and such as entitled
him to expect his turn of promotion in due course. He continued in
India from the early part of 1810 till the latter end of 1813, when
he returned to England. He had not been long at home, when he was
draughted, along with a select number of midshipmen, for the
purpose of being sent to Portsmouth, to be instructed by Angelo,
the famous fencing-master, in the cutlass exercise, with the view
of introducing that mode of defence and attack into the navy. These
young men, when perfected in the art, were distributed through the
fleet, as teachers of the young officers and men. Clapperton, being
an apt pupil, soon excelled in this exercise, and when his
companions were distributed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_73">[73]</span> through the fleet as drill-masters, he was
sent to the Asia, the flag ship of Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane,
then lying at Spithead.</p>

<h3>Sect. VI.—<span class="med">HIS SERVICE ON THE LAKES OF CANADA.</span></h3>

<p>While he taught Angelo’s sword-exercise on board the Asia, he
volunteered his services for the lakes of Canada, in the expedition
which was sent to that novel scene of naval enterprise towards the
beginning of the year 1814. In the voyage from England to
Bermuda<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> he continued<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> to act as a drill-master on board the Asia;
and though, as yet, he had obtained no higher rank than that of
midshipman, such was the respect in which he was held, and the
deference paid to him, that in most respects he was treated as if
he had been a lieutenant. He was now a tall and handsome young man,
with great breadth of chest and expansion of shoulders, and
possessing withal a mild temper and the kindest dispositions. Along
with his other duties he drilled the young officers and men on
deck, whenever the weather permitted, and when amusement was the
order of the day, he was the life and soul of the crew; he was an
excellent table companion, he could tell humourous tales, and his
conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> was
extremely amusing; he painted scenes for the ship’s theatricals,
sketched views, drew caricatures, and so he was much beloved and
respected by all, to whose amusement he so largely contributed.</p>

<p>The following incident affords a striking proof of the almost
invincible hardiness of his constitution, for which he was indebted
partly to the bounty of nature, and partly to the privations and
habits of his early life. Having bidden adieu to the flag ship, on
which he had acted so conspicuous a part, and taken his passage to
Halifax, with the view of thence proceeding to the lakes, he was
sent along with others to perform some service on the horrid coast
of Labrador, and being there cast away while in a long boat, all
the individuals who were along with him at the time were so
severely frost bitten that some of them died, and the rest were
lame for life, while he escaped with only losing the power of the
first joint of his left hand thumb, which ever after continued
crooked, and on that account used to be called “Hooky,” both by
himself and his friends.</p>

<p>He was sent, along with a party of five hundred men, from
Halifax to join Sir James Yeo, who, at that time, had the command
upon the Lakes. As this journey was performed in winter, when the
river St. Lawrence is frozen over, and of course when the water
communication is suspended, it was both tedious and toilsome. The
men marched on foot, first<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_76">[76]</span> to Quebec, and then to the lakes, while the
baggage was dragged after them in <em>sleighs</em>. Soon after his
arrival on the lakes, he and a small party of men were appointed to
defend a blockhouse on the coast of Lake Ontario; but he had not
been long in this situation when the blockhouse, which had only one
small gun for its defence, was attacked by a superior American
force, by which it was speedily demolished; and when Clapperton and
his men were left no other alternative but to become prisoners of
war, or to cross the ice to York, the capital of Upper Canada, a
distance of sixty or seventy miles. Frightful as the attempt was,
in their destitute and forlorn circumstances, the journey was
instantly resolved upon. But the party had not advanced more than
ten or twelve miles, when a boy, one of the number, lay down on the
ice unable to proceed farther, on account of the cold, and his
previous fatigue. The sailors declared, each in his turn, that they
were so benumbed with cold, and so exhausted by wading through the
newly fallen snow, that it was with difficulty they could support
themselves, and so could afford no assistance to the poor
unfortunate boy. On this trying occasion the strong benevolence of
Clapperton’s character was strikingly manifested. His nature was
too generous to suffer him for a moment to endure the idea of
leaving a fellow-creature inevitably to perish under such appalling
circumstances; for as it was snowing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_77">[77]</span> at the time, it was quite evident that the
boy would, if left, have been quickly overwhelmed by the drift.
Clapperton, therefore, took the boy upon his own back, and carried
him about eight or nine miles, when he found that he had relaxed
his hold, and on examining the cause, he was perceived to be in a
dying state, and very soon after expired. The party then proceeded
on their journey, and endured very great sufferings before they
could reach York. Their shoes and stockings were completely worn
off their feet; and the want of nourishment had dreadfully
emaciated their bodies, as they had no provisions during the
journey except a bag of meal. According to his uncle’s account, it
was, while he was making generous efforts to save the boy, who fell
a victim to the cold, that Clapperton lost the first joint of his
thumb. His uncle says, “he took the boy upon his back, holding him
with his left hand, and supported himself from slipping with a
staff in his right;” and adds, “that from the long inaction of his
left hand in carrying the boy upon his back, he lost, from the
effects of the cold, his thumb joint.”—This is certainly a very
probable account of the matter, and assigns a cause sufficiently
adequate for effecting a greater bodily injury than the loss of
part of a thumb. But, as we have great confidence in the
information which we have received on the subject, we are inclined
to adhere to the account which we have given above, namely,
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> Clapperton lost
the joint of his thumb on the coast of Labrador, when his
companions in distress lost their limbs and their lives. It is
evident, moreover, that his uncle’s information on many points was
neither very extensive nor very accurate. A glaring instance of
inaccuracy is abundantly apparent in his account of this very
journey over the ice, from the demolished blockhouse to York, the
capital of Upper Canada. He asserts that this journey was performed
from the coast of Lake Huron, across Lake Michigan, to the town of
York—an exploit which any one, by slightly inspecting a map of
North America, will instantly see is impossible to be
accomplished.</p>

<p>After Sir Edward Owen was appointed to the command of the
British naval force upon the Canadian lakes, he gave Clapperton an
acting order as a lieutenant, and appointed him to the command of
the Confiance schooner. This was a situation, which, as it implied
more responsibility than any he had hitherto held, likewise allowed
him a greater degree of liberty than he could have enjoyed, had he
been assigned a birth on board of a vessel commanded by a superior
officer. When, therefore, he had the command of the Confiance, he
was in the habit of making excursions into the forests on the
coast, both of lake Huron and lake Erie, for the purpose of
shooting game. While engaged in these excursions, he cultivated an
acquaintance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
several of the Indian tribes. The romantic turn of his mind led him
not only to delight to associate with those aboriginal inhabitants
of America, but also to adopt their manners and customs, and even
to acquire their language. He became a great favourite among them;
for he sometimes treated them with feasts, and on these occasions
they used to fire a <em>feu de joie</em> in honour of him as their
benefactor. At one time, indeed, he entertained serious intentions
of uniting himself to the Indians, marrying a princess, and thereby
becoming a chief among them; and actually assumed the distinctive
badge of the Huron nation. This romantic and foolish design was,
however, soon relinquished; but the feasts which he had given to
the chiefs led to deficiency in his accounts to the victualling
department; and this deficiency was afterwards deducted from his
half pay, and was the means of involving him in pecuniary
difficulties, from which he was not altogether relieved till after
his return from his first expedition from Africa.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this fact, he was a most active, diligent,
and efficient officer, while he served upon the lakes; so that it
was the wish of Sir Edward Owen that the acting order which he had
given him should be confirmed by the Board of Admiralty; and for
this end Clapperton sent it to his uncle in London; but as the
Board of Admiralty had just promoted a great number of naval
officers, they refused<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_80">[80]</span> to confirm his commission at that time. It
was the feeling of disappointment arising from this refusal which
made him form the design of permanently connecting himself with the
Indians. When he went on shore to visit his friends among these
tribes, he did not always order a boat to be in attendance upon him
to bring him on board; but when he regarded it as time to return,
he used to plunge into the water with his clothes on, swim along
side of the schooner, and hail the people on board to take him up.
This rash mode of proceeding, however, nearly cost him his life;
for on one occasion he encountered a strong current which bore him
away from his own schooner, the Confiance; and it was with
difficulty he could make himself be heard, as in distress, and
unable to bear up against the stream, by the men on board the
schooner commanded by Lieutenant Adam Gordon, who sent a boat to
fetch him on board. This adventure put an end to the exploits of
swimming to and from the vessel, when he had occasion to be on
shore. While he served on the lakes, he was distinguished by
another singular practice. In the midst of winter he was in the
habit of causing the ice to be broken daily for the purpose of
making an opening in which he might bathe. He used to say, he felt
a shock when he first plunged into the cold water, but that this
was followed by a pleasant glow. The place which was broken in the
ice, for the indulgence of this luxury, was with great propriety
designated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
“Clapperton’s bath,” as no one else chose to participate with him
in this species of pleasure. Yet amidst all these singularities he
never neglected his duty as an officer; he loved to keep the
sailors upon the alert; and when he <em>rowed guard</em>, he
delighted to surprise the sentinels.</p>

<p>Like most other Scotsmen, when at a distance from their native
land, he displayed a strong feeling of <em>amor patriæ</em>, and
was particularly attentive to any of his countrymen he happened to
meet with abroad, a fact which perhaps laid the foundation of his
attachment to Mackenzie. At any rate, when he was on the lakes,
there happened to be some species of merry-making among the
officers, when he met, for the first time, a gentleman from
Edinburgh, belonging to the medical department. As he had a very
youthful appearance, Clapperton supposed that he must be
inexperienced, and from a sincere desire to be serviceable to him,
he took him aside and advised him always to maintain his rights,
gave him some sage advice about his dress, and decorated his right
thigh with a brilliant, scarlet-coloured watch ribbon. This
gentleman took all in good part, assumed the aspect of the
greenhorn which Clapperton supposed him to be, and allowed him both
to direct and decorate him as he pleased. But when he understood
that he was of considerable standing in the service, he came to him
and apologized for his mistake—a thing which was of course
accepted, and the curious incident proved the
commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> of a
sincere and firm friendship on both sides.</p>

<h3 class="hang1">Sect. VII.—<span class="med">HIS SECOND STEP OF PROMOTION, AND HIS
CONDUCT WHILE AN OFFICER ON HALF-PAY.</span></h3>

<p>When Sir Edward Owen returned to England towards the end of
1816, he got Clapperton’s commission confirmed. Previous to this he
had been examined as to his knowledge of naval tactics, and the
information which he had displayed both as a theoretical and
practical seaman was highly satisfactory to his examinators. The
manner especially in which he had kept his log-book, was the cause
of procuring for him the greatest encomiums. It is the practice of
the officers of his majesty’s ships to note down at noon, in their
log-books, what sails the ships to which they respectively belong,
then carry. And as Clapperton had a natural talent for drawing,
which he had cultivated with care, instead of doing this in the
ordinary way, he represented the state of his ship’s canvass, at
the hour required, by a spirited sketch. He likewise shewed, by the
ingenious efforts of his pencil, the different headlands and the
peculiar appearance of the coasts, together with their harbours,
noting at the same time their soundings, and the mode of
approaching them. This log-book was so highly approved by his
examinators, that they<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_83">[83]</span> asked him to allow them to transmit it to the
Admiralty—a request which being readily granted, it was sent there,
where it still remains. As Great Britain was now at peace with the
whole world, Lieutenant Clapperton like many others was put on half
pay, and soon afterwards returned to Edinburgh in 1817.</p>

<p>He had not been long in Edinburgh after his return from the
Lakes, till he was surprised to hear himself inquired after by the
attendants of an elegant equipage, which had stopped at his
lodgings. This equipage proved to be that of Lady Seaforth, the
mother of his respected friend Mackenzie, whom he had met in India.
This lady, prompted by the feelings of gratitude with which she had
been inspired by the account which her beloved son had given her
with his dying breath, of the unremitting kindness and attention
which he had experienced from Clapperton during his illness in
India, had been very anxious to have a personal interview with him,
that she might have an opportunity of expressing to him the
obligations which his friendship for her son had laid upon her. For
this end she had made many inquiries respecting him even at the
Admiralty, and at length she discovered where he was to be found
through means of her relative, Lieutenant Proby, and had come to
call upon him. The name of Lady Seaforth speedily brought to his
recollection the imputation of the interested motives to which his
friendship for her son had been attributed, and at first he refused
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> see her. He
however, at that time lived with a gentleman—the same he had been
so anxious should cut a respectable appearance among the officers
on the Lakes—who represented to him the ill breeding and absurdity
of refusing to see her ladyship, when she had done him the honour
of waiting upon him. He then went into her ladyship’s presence, who
being overpowered by her feelings, almost overwhelmed him with her
kindness. After the occurrence of this scene, Clapperton was
persuaded by the same gentleman, to accept of Lady Seaforth’s
invitations to visit her at her own house. And from that period,
during all the time he was in Edinburgh, he was a frequent guest
and inmate there, and was uniformly treated with the greatest
kindness, but he steadily and even resolutely refused to be in any
way indebted to her ladyship beyond the common forms of
hospitality. It was needless for the grateful lady to offer to
exert her influence in his behalf in reference to promotion in his
profession. Clapperton would not hear of such a thing. It was in
vain that both she and her daughters urged him to accept of a gold
watch, chain, and seals, to be worn by him as a token of the sense
they entertained of his kindness towards the son and the brother of
whom they had been bereaved. Our hero positively declined their
generous offer, declaring that he had already a most capital watch,
and had no occasion for another. Sometime afterwards her ladyship
sent him a large package of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_85">[85]</span> books, chiefly on religious subjects; these
likewise he was determined to return, till it was represented to
him that he must not only retain the books, but thank Lady Seaforth
for sending them, with a promise to peruse them diligently,
otherwise he would be regarded by her and her family as a downright
heathen. The only other thing which he would accept from Lady
Seaforth, was a lock of her son’s hair, which he received as a
token of affection, and ever after wore in a locket about his
person. He always declared that he had a sincere regard for Lady
Seaforth, and was very much affected with her kindness, but such
was the morbid sensitiveness of his nature on this point, cherished
by the rankling recollection of what his messmates had unjustly
said of him, that he was of opinion he could accept of nothing
either from herself, or procured through her interest, without
compromising his principles of honour and independence. How
different is all this from the common ways of the world!</p>

<p>During the greater part of the year 1818, and part of 1819,
Clapperton lived with an aunt in Lochmaben, Dumfries-shire. While
domesticated with his aunt, who was a sister of his mother’s, and
of whom, in his letters to his friends, he speaks with much
affection, he applied himself to the study of the French language;
his open and frank manners likewise procured him many friendships,
and many curious anecdotes are told of his sailor-like
conduct,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> in paying
little regard to the ordinary <em>etiquette</em> of social
intercourse. Like other sailors on shore, he seemed to be of
opinion that nothing should obstruct the gratification of his whims
and oddities. Hence he was sometimes disposed to pay unseasonable
visits to his friends, and not to be particularly ceremonious as to
the mode in which he entered the houses of those with whom he lived
in terms of intimacy; but he was much beloved while he resided in
Dumfries-shire, by all to whom he was known.</p>

<p>Clapperton, however, soon tired of the dullness of a country
life; and so returned to Edinburgh, and went to live with the
gentleman with whom he had resided when he was so much embarrassed
by the kindness of Lady Seaforth. Here, being an entirely idle man,
fond of adventures withal, and in a place where they might easily
be found, he soon had a hand in some curious scenes. Having little
idea of economy, and not being well acquainted with the value of
money, and indeed caring nothing for it whatever, provided he got
enough to serve his purposes at the time when it was wanted, the
quarterly items of his half pay did not last him long. Indeed, he
entertained some singular notions on the subject of borrowing
money, and when he had recourse to his friends for a supply, he
gave them to understand that he was doing them a favour by becoming
their debtor. As an instance of the careless way in which he parted
with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> money when
in Edinburgh, we may mention the following incident. At this time a
young man, the son of a staunch anti-patronist, was figuring away
in this town as a popular preacher, in which capacity he became so
notorious, that week after week he was puffed in the newspapers,
and was attended by vast crowds on Sunday, when he held forth in a
well known chapel of ease. This person happened to meet Clapperton
one day just after he had drawn his quarter’s pay; and he
immediately laid a plan, and forthwith commenced the putting of it
in practice, for the purpose of getting possession of a
considerable share of it. He said to Clapperton that he had that
day met with a great disappointment, in not getting from his
friends a remittance of money which he had expected; that now he
would not get it before Monday; nor would he have cared for the
delay of a day or two, had he not promised to pay his tailor’s
account, and regretted exceedingly that he should not be able to do
it, as he was a lover of punctuality, and was anxious above every
thing to keep his word. At the end of this fair speech, Clapperton
asked his reverend friend how much money would serve his purpose,
and was told that ten pounds would do all he wanted, till he heard
from his friends on Monday. Clapperton, believing the man to be
honest, gave him the sum specified, when the reverend gentleman
asked him to go to Barclay’s hotel and he would treat him to his
dinner. Away they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
went. An excellent dinner was set upon the table and discussed.
Madeira, champaign, and other expensive wines were called for, and
the two got cheerful, joyous, happy, glorious. At length the
swindler, as he proved to be, made some pretence for going out for
a little. He went, but never returned, and Clapperton, in addition
to the ten pounds which he had given him, never to see again, had a
bill of between two and three pounds more to pay before he could
leave the house.</p>

<p>Barclay’s was the place where Clapperton and his friends
generally met for <em>enjeuement</em>; and though, with the
exception of a single individual, none of them were addicted to
intemperance, sometimes very curious scenes occurred, of which a
specimen or two may serve both to amuse our readers and to develope
our hero’s character. He was told of a swaggering fellow, who
generally sat at the bar, and boasted of his extraordinary
strength, and his profound knowledge of the <em>fancy</em> science;
Clapperton walked up to him one night, and said in a loud
determined tone, “Sir, I am told you are a bully; I should like to
try a round or two with you.” The poor man was so much terrified
that he walked off, and never returned to the house again. One
night, as he was going home, with another of his friends, and the
individual, who was apt to take a cup too much, and whom, perhaps
from the circumstance that he was too frequently in a state of
imbecility, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> were
accustomed, by the rule of contraries, to call Able; the difficulty
they found in keeping Able steady threw the other gentleman into a
fit of laughter which he could not restrain. Clapperton, thinking
it was cruel to laugh at poor Able’s infirmity, placed him against
the railing, in front of the College, and fairly knocked the
laugher down, and then apologized to him for what he had done. On
the same occasion, when he had Able in tow, the latter fell down on
the curb stone of the pavement, and Clapperton found that he could
not raise him up again, and so, though it was eleven o’clock at
night, he said, “My dear fellow, I cannot set you on your feet
again, but I shall do all that man can do, I shall sit down beside
you,” and so fairly sat down beside him till more assistance was
procured. But the most amusing of his frolics, of which we have
heard any account, was the method he took to get into his lodgings
one night when he happened to be rather late out. He had rung the
door bell several times without being answered; so he went and
brought a long heavy ladder, belonging to a house painter, and
reared it in front of the house in which he lodged. Then he mounted
it, opened the window of his own room, went in, and then hurled the
ladder down, the rubbing of which on the wall made a loud and
uncommon noise which disturbed the neighbourhood. This latter part
of our hero’s proceeding was observed by the watchman, who called
some of his companions, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90">[90]</span> came to reconnoitre. On seeing the ladder
lying on the pavement, they naturally imagined that it was the
instrument by which thieves had broken into some of the upper
flats. Immediately a tremendous ringing commenced at the door of
the house into which Clapperton a few minutes before had entered by
the window. The door was opened, and in came the policemen, who
insisted that they had seen some person enter the house through a
window, with the aid of a ladder, which was still lying below. By
this time Clapperton was in bed, and had found means to request the
people in the house not to betray him. But the policemen were not
to be satisfied with the assurance that there was no person in the
house but such as belonged to it. They searched every hole and
corner, and at length they found wet clothes; and as the night was
rainy, they naturally conjectured that they must belong to the man
who had come in by the window. On this Clapperton, laughing
heartily, raised himself up in his bed, and told the vigilant
policemen how the matter stood, and on giving them his name, and
his promise to pay any expenses which might be incurred by this
frolic, they departed. The ladder was carried to the police office,
and was with difficulty conveyed thither by three stout men. At the
police office, the whole was viewed as a piece of sailor-like
humour, and Clapperton got off on paying a trifling sum, and the
house painter was ordered<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> to chain his ladder to his premises in
future.</p>

<h3>Sect. VIII.—<span class="med">HIS FIRST EXPEDITION TO AFRICA.</span></h3>

<p>By this time our hero had become acquainted with Dr. Oudney, at
whose house we have had the pleasure of occasionally meeting him;
and when the Doctor was appointed to his exploratory expedition to
Africa, he expressed, through the medium of the common friend of
both, and to whose information we have been much indebted in
drawing up our memoir of their lives, his desire to be attached to
the mission. Clapperton could not boast the possession of much
either of the literary or the scientific knowledge requisite to
constitute the intelligent traveller; but he was distinguished for
other qualities fitted to render him a valuable acquisition to any
mission similar to that to the accomplishment of which Dr. Oudney
had been appointed. The portrait prefixed to the “Journal of his
second Expedition,” shows that his figure was tall, strong, and
manly. He had a fine bust, and his whole frame combined length of
arm, great strength, weight, and agility—circumstances which the
portrait does not sufficiently represent, and is also deficient in
expressing his fine lion-like forehead and eye. We have seen that
he was endowed with a constitution<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_92">[92]</span> of almost invincible strength, that he
possessed a most enterprising disposition of mind, great
conscientiousness in the discharge of duty, and a heart alive to
the kindly impressions of compassion, and capable of strong and
steady friendship. Such a travelling companion was likely to be a
treasure to a man like Dr. Oudney; and he had the pleasure to be
informed that his application to have Clapperton attached to the
mission was granted.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the autumn of 1821, the travellers left Scotland
for London, with the view of then commencing their expedition to
the interior of Africa. In a letter to a friend dated London,
September 1, 1821, Clapperton says, he had been supplied with arms,
and had got instruments of his own choosing, and mentions the
sextant as the most complete he had ever seen; he states to his
friend that he had had several agreeable interviews with his uncle;
and adds, that he was just on the eve of setting off for Falmouth.
His next letter to the same gentleman was written at Mourzuk, May
20, 1822, in which he tells his friend that his health had
continued vigorous, although the heat was 106 degrees of
Fahrenheit, in the shade; and says, that Oudney was much admired by
the ladies for the blackness of his beard, and himself for the
strength of his mustachoes. Oudney in a postscript on the same
sheet, says, “Clapperton is just the old<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> man. He is a strange-looking figure with his
long sandy coloured beard and mustachoes. You would smile were you
to see him smoking his pipe, and calling to his servant, <em>Waddy
ama simpri</em>, or fill my pipe.” In a subsequent letter from the
same place, to the same correspondent, Clapperton speaks in praise
of the Tuaricks, whom by this time, (Sept. 1822) he had visited. He
says they are a fine warlike race, who fear nothing but the devil
and his agents, that they offered to convey both him and Oudney to
Timbuctoo; and adds, “They wished me much to take a wife amongst
them, but I said she would have to go to Bournou and England with
me, which got me out of the scrape with a good grace, as their
women never leave their country, and those who marry them must stay
with them.” And the fact is that our hero very soon found himself
as much at home among the wild Tauricks, who traverse the sandy
deserts of Sahaara, as he had formerly done among the Indians who
dwell in the midst of the forests of Canada.</p>

<p>It would seem that Clapperton did not regard it as any part of
his duty to keep a separate journal while Oudney lived; nor was it
necessary, as they were generally together in all the excursions
which they made in Fezzan, and their joint observations were
combined by the Doctor into the same narrative, to which he put his
own name. But the case was greatly altered after the arrival of the
travellers in Bournou, where Oudney was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> seized with the illness which terminated in
death, upon the 12th of January, 1824. After this mournful event,
Clapperton, sick and sorrowful as he was, proceeded onward to Kano,
with the view of visiting Sackatoo, as was originally intended. He
reached this city, (as may be seen in his printed journal) upon the
16th of March, and had many interviews and long conversations with
the sultan, Bello. He remained at Sackatoo till the 4th of May,
when he began to retrace his steps,—again reached Kuka upon the 8th
of July, and arrived in London in the summer of 1825. Clapperton
and Denham came from Tripoli to Leghorn, sent the animals and
baggage home by sea, under the charge of Hillman, their only
surviving companion, while they themselves crossed the Alps, and on
the 1st of June, 1825, they reported their arrival in England to
Earl Bathurst, under whose auspices the mission had been sent to
Africa.</p>

<h3>Sect. IX.—<span class="med">HIS SECOND EXPEDITION TO AFRICA.</span></h3>

<p>The result of the expedition was upon the whole favourable, and
afforded encouragement to make farther researches in the interior
of Africa; and especially a letter from Bello, the sultan of the
Fellatahs, addressed to our King, George IV. and brought to England
by Clapperton, was the occasion of his second
expedition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> In that
letter Sultan Bello proposed “The establishment of a friendly
intercourse between the two nations, by means of a consul who was
to reside at the seaport of Raka;—the delivery of certain presents
described, at the port of Funda, (supposed to be somewhere near
Whidah);—and the prohibition of the exportation of slaves by any of
the Houssa merchants, to Atagher, Dahomy, or Ashantee.” These
proposals of the Fallatah sultan led to the resolution forthwith to
send out a second expedition to Africa, and our hero, now Captain
Clapperton, immediately volunteered his services on the occasion,
with whom were associated in the same hazardous enterprise, Captain
Pearce, Dr. Morrison, and Dr. Dickson, with their respective
attendants.</p>

<p>Soon after Clapperton’s return to London from his first
expedition to Africa, he wrote to the friend with whom he had lived
during his residence in Edinburgh, expressing the pleasure which he
felt in being again in Britain, and informing him, that since his
arrival in London, he had been so busily employed in making out
reports to government, that he had not a moment’s leisure to attend
either to pleasure or friendship. In a subsequent letter, he told
him, that along with his other duties and avocations, he had to
prepare his part of the “journal of the expedition,” that it might
be ready for publication before his departure on the second
mission. “I have got,” says he, “no sinecure in this new
appointment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> I have
to see the whole of the presents sent off without any one to assist
me. My Journal will scarce be complete before I go, and the
necessary attendance at the public offices is truly harassing.” In
a letter of a later date, he says “You cannot have any idea of the
infinite trouble and anxiety I have had since I have been in
London. If I receive honour and praise, they are assuredly earned
with labour and pain. The whole of the arrangements for the new
mission have fallen upon me. To give you an outline of what I am to
do, or where I am to go, is at present impossible, but when I get
to sea I shall write to you more fully.” From Portsmouth, 27th
August, 1825, he tells the same correspondent, “We leave England
this morning; and as far as I am concerned, I have experienced
nothing but misery and trouble since my arrival, and look forward
to our voyage for peace and rest.” In this letter, he mentions that
Mr. Brown of the Linnæan Society had called one of the plants in
Dr. Oudney’s collection by the name of that lamented gentleman, and
after sending compliments and remembrances to several of his
intimate acquaintances, he bids an affecting, and, as it proved, a
final farewell to his “dear friend.”</p>

<p>On the 27th of August 1825, Captain Clapperton and his
associates of this second expedition, with their servants, embarked
in his Majesty’s ship Brazen, at Portsmouth, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> arrived off Whidah on the 26th
of November thereafter. Here Dr. Dickson landed for the purpose of
proceeding into the interior, along with a Portuguese named De
Seusa. The design of their journey is not unfolded in any of the
journals which have been published by the travellers; but the
agreement between Dr. Dickson and Captain Clapperton was, that
after the former had traversed the kingdom of Dahomy and the
adjacent countries, he should rejoin his friend, the Captain, at
Jennah. Lander, in his recently published “Records of Captain
Clapperton,” says the parting between the friends was tender and
affecting, and seemed to intimate that they should meet again no
more. “Study the natives well,” said the Captain to the Doctor,
“respect their institutions, and be kind to them on all occasions;
for it is on paying proper respect to these rules, and these only,
that you must ground your hope of being successful in your progress
through the country; and the conduct of the people to you will be
guided by your behaviour towards them. Set a guard upon your
temper, my dear Dickson, and never, let it lead you into error.”
“We meet at Jennah, then,” said the Doctor, with an inquiring eye,
and anxious half doubting look. “We meet at Jennah,” answered
Captain Clapperton, solemnly. “Once more adieu, my dear Dickson,
and may God bless and protect you.” Lander adds, that it was
reported that Dr. Dickson was slain in a quarrel with
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> natives, about
two days’ journey from Shar; and so was the first of the mission
who fell a victim to African research.</p>

<p>The Brazen proceeded with the other members of the mission to
the river Benin or Formosa; and on the advice of Mr. Houtson, an
English merchant whom they met there, they relinquished the plan of
ascending that river, and went into the interior from Badagry. They
could hear no tidings at Whidah either of Sultan Bello or of his
messengers, and as for Funda and Raka, such towns were wholly
unknown at that place.</p>

<p>Besides the gentlemen of the mission, whose names have been
already mentioned, there were in the capacity of servants,
Columbus, a West Indian mulatto, who had accompanied Major Denham
in the previous journey; Pasko, a black native of Houssa, who had
served on board an English man-of-war, and though a great
scoundrel, was useful as an interpreter; George Dawson, an English
sailor, engaged at Badagry, as servant to Dr. Morrison; and Richard
Lander, Captain Clapperton’s own confidential servant. This man had
been a wanderer from his youth. When only eleven years of age, he
accompanied a mercantile gentleman to the West Indies. He was
absent three years; and on his return went to France and other
places on the continent, as a gentleman’s servant, and continued
abroad in that capacity till his nineteenth year. On his return
home, he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> stay
long in his native country, but went to South Africa with Major
Colebrook, and traversed, along with that gentleman, the whole of
the Cape colony, from one extremity to the other. The reason why he
left Major Colebrook has not been made public, but, on his return
to England in 1824, he heard of Captain Clapperton’s second
expedition to the interior of Africa, and regarding the adventure
as something peculiarly suited to his roving disposition, he went
to the Captain and tendered his services, which were accepted. His
own account of the matter is as follows:—“The Captain listened to
me with attention, and after I had answered a few interrogations,
willingly engaged me to be his confidential servant. In this
interview the keen penetrating eye of the African traveller did not
escape my observation, and by its fire, energy, and quickness,
depicted, in my own opinion at least, the very soul of enterprise
and adventure.” This man continued faithful and attached to
Clapperton to the last; and to him we are indebted for the
preservation of his beloved master’s journal, from which, in
connexion with his own recently published “Records” of the
Expedition, we derive all that can now be known of the last stage
of Captain Clapperton’s short but eventful career.<a id=
"FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Clapperton and his associates commenced<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_100">[100]</span> their journey from Badagry upon the 7th of
December 1825; and, regardless of what they could not but know
either from the information of others, or—as was the case with some
of them at least—from their own personal experience, that an
African climate was most unfriendly to European constitutions, they
were guilty of the great imprudence of sleeping the first night of
their journey upon the low and swampy banks of the river, or rather
creek, named Bawie, under the open canopy of heaven. Lander says
they had previously been drinking; and adds, that next morning they
found themselves wet to the skin with the heavy dew which had
fallen during the night. And, as he remarks, after the Quarterly
Review, “in all probability were thus sown the seeds of those
disorders which subsequently broke out with such fatal virulence,
and produced suffering, disease, and death to almost the whole of
the little party.” The second night after that was likewise spent
in the open air, and, in the morning, the clothes of the party were
saturated with dew. This exceedingly imprudent conduct was speedily
followed by its natural consequences. On the 10th Clapperton was
seized with ague, from which it would appear he never perfectly
recovered. Dr. Morrison and Captain Pearce soon after became very
unwell, and died before they had proceeded far on their journey.
About the same time one of the servants died, and Lander was so ill
that no hopes were entertained<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_101">[101]</span> of his recovery. The loss of Captain Pearce
is thus bewailed by his friend and companion in danger, Captain
Clapperton: “The death of Captain Pearce has caused me much
concern; for, independently of his amiable qualities as a friend
and companion, he was eminently fitted, by his talents, his
perseverance, and his fortitude, to be of singular service to the
mission, and on these accounts I deplore his loss as the greatest I
could have sustained, both as regards my private feelings and the
public service.” One day about this time, when our traveller was
sick and sorrowful, as he reposed under the shade of trees which
skirted the way, unable to proceed, a native, on horseback, moved
by the kindness of a generous nature, quickly dismounted, and
offered the invalid the use of his horse—a proffer which was
gratefully accepted. Both Clapperton and Lander speak with rapture
respecting the beauty and fertility of the country through which
they passed, from the western coast to the City of Sackatoo, where
their journey and the life of the former were unhappily terminated.
The country is represented by them as extremely populous, and the
inhabitants, unless when selfish feelings intervened, as possessing
very kind, and even generous dispositions. Our traveller did all in
his power to recover the books, papers, and other property, which
might have been left by the unfortunate and lamented Mungo Park, as
well as to ascertain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_102">[102]</span> an accurate account of the manner of his
death, but with little success. The chiefs in the neighbourhood of
Boussa, where the event occurred, were anxious to avoid all
communication on the subject; and some of them were greatly
embarrassed when they were questioned respecting it. He received
the following account of the death of that unfortunate traveller
from an eye-witness:—“He said, that when the boat came down the
river, it happened unfortunately just at the time that the
Fellatahs first rose in arms, and were ravaging Goobur and Zamfra;
that the Sultan of Boussa, on hearing that the persons in the boat
were white men, and that the boat was different from any that had
ever been seen before, as she had a house at one end, called his
people together from the neighbouring towns, attacked and killed
them, not doubting that they were the advance guard of the Fellatah
army then ravaging Soudan, under the command of Malem Danfodio, the
father of the present Bello; that one of the white men was a tall
man, with long hair; that they fought for three days before they
were killed; that the people in the neighbourhood were very much
alarmed, and great numbers fled to Niffé and other countries,
thinking that the Fellatahs were certainly among them. The number
of persons in the boat was only four, two white men and two blacks;
that they found great treasure in the boat; but that the people had
all died who eat of the meat that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_103">[103]</span> was found in her.” “This account,”
Clapperton adds, “I believe to be the most correct of all that I
have yet got; and was told to me without my putting any questions,
or showing any eagerness for him to go on with his story.”</p>

<p>At Wawa, or according to Lander’s orthography of the town, Waw
Waw, Clapperton had a singular adventure with a rich widow of
Arabian extraction. This lady was between 30 and 40 years of age,
and being fairer than the natives of the city of her residence, was
anxious to be regarded as a white woman. She was the richest person
in Wawa, having the best house in town, and a thousand slaves; and
was withal a “perfect Turkish beauty—just like a walking
water-butt.” Her great riches, and her intriguing disposition, had
prompted her oftener than once to rise in rebellion against her
rightful sovereign, who always had the gallantry generously to
pardon her on her submission. Though it might have been supposed
that the age of the tender passions was over with the widow, yet
she fell violently in love with Lander, and tried all the female
arts and winning ways her ingenuity could suggest to induce him to
visit her at her own house, but without success. She, however,
visited him; and on these occasions Clapperton humoured the joke,
and fanned the love-sick widow’s flame by sounding the praises of
his servant. He sat with as much <em>non challance</em> as if
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> had been at home
in a Scottish cottage, with his arms folded, rolling out great
volumes of smoke from his pipe, enjoying this singular scene of
African courtship, and saying at intervals, to induce the widow to
persevere in her suit, “See what beautiful eyes he has,—if you were
to search from Badagry to Wawa, and from Wawa to Badagry, you would
not find such eyes.” While all the time poor Lander was embarrassed
with the amorous attentions of the widow, and was afraid lest he
should be squeezed to death by the closeness of her tender
embraces. At length he mustered courage fairly to tell her that he
could not return her passion; and though she afterwards ceased to
persecute him farther, she was not, as many of her sex in similar
circumstances would have been, actuated by the least feeling of
revenge. On the contrary, she continued to regard him with kindness
to the last, but forthwith transferred her love to Clapperton.</p>

<p>To ingratiate herself with him, she sent him rich and abundant
store of provisions ready cooked, and endeavoured to gain his black
rascal of a servant, Pasko, to her interests, by bribing him with a
handsome female slave for a wife. She invited the captain to pay
her a visit, which he accepted, and has given us, in his journal,
the following graphic account of his entertainment:—</p>

<p>“Not being much afraid of myself, and wishing to see the
interior arrangement of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_105">[105]</span> her house, I went and visited her. I found
her house large, and full of male and female slaves; the males
lying about the outer huts, the females more in the interior. In
the centre of the huts was a square one of large dimensions,
surrounded by verandahs, with screens of matting all around, except
in one place, where there was hung a tanned bullock’s hide; to this
spot I was led up, and, on its being drawn to one side, I saw the
lady sitting cross-legged on a small Turkey carpet, like one of our
hearth-rugs, a large leather cushion under her left knee; her
goora-pot, which was a large old-fashioned pewter mug, by her side,
and a calebash of water to wash her mouth out, as she alternately
kept eating goora, and chewing tobacco snuff, the custom with all
ranks, male or female, who can procure them; on her right side lay
a whip. At a little distance, squatted on the ground, sat a
dwarfish hump-backed female slave, with a wide mouth, but good
eyes; she had on no clothing, if I except a profusion of strings of
beads and coral round her neck and waist. This personage served the
purposes of a bell in our country, and what, I suppose, would in
old times have been called a page. The lady herself was dressed in
a white clean muslin turban; her neck profusely decorated with
necklaces of coral and gold chains, amongst which was one of rubies
and gold beads; her eyebrows and eyelashes black, her hair dyed
with indigo, and her hands and feet with henna;<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> around her body she had a fine
striped silk and cotton country cloth, which came as high as her
tremendous breasts, and reached as low as her ankles; in her right
hand she held a fan made of stained grass, of a square form. She
desired me to sit down on the carpet beside her, which I did, and
she began fanning me, and sent hump-back to bring out her finery
for me to look at; which consisted of four gold bracelets, two
large paper dressing-cases, with looking-glasses, and several
strings of coral, silver rings, and bracelets, with a number of
other trifling articles. After a number of compliments, and giving
me an account of all her wealth, I was led through one apartment
into another, cool, clean, and ornamented with pewter dishes and
bright brass pans. She now told me her husband had been dead these
ten years, that she had only one son and he was darker than
herself; that she loved white men, and would go to Boussa with me.
I thought this was carrying the joke a little too far, and began to
look very serious, on which she sent for the looking-glass, and
looking at herself, then offering it to me, said, to be sure she
was rather older than I was, but very little, and what of that?
This was too much, and I made my retreat as soon as I could,
determined never to come to such close quarters with her
again.”</p>

<p>A short time after this interview with the beautiful and amorous
widow Zuma, Clapperton went to Boussa, leaving Lander
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> his baggage in
Wawa; and though the widow did not actually accompany him in his
journey thither, as she had intimated her intention of doing; yet
she followed very speedily after him. On this occasion, Lander
informs us, she was dressed in a mantle of scarlet silk and gold,
and loose trowsers of scarlet silk, with red morocco boots, and an
ample white turban on her head; she rode astride on a noble horse
decorated with brass plates and bells, with a profusion of charms
or amulets in green, red, and yellow leather. Her saddle-cloth was
of scarlet, and both widow and horse were singularly imposing. In
her train were many spearmen and bowmen on horseback, with a band
of musicians furnished with drums, fiddles, guitars, and
flutes.</p>

<p>The romantic intention of Zuma was to accompany Clapperton
wherever he went. The Sultan, however, was anxious, for the sake of
his revenue and the security of his throne, to counteract the
widow’s designs; and his first step for that end was to put an
embargo on Lander and Clapperton’s baggage, and his next was to
despatch a strong party in pursuit of the fugitive widow, with
strict injunctions to bring her back. This was accomplished, and,
on her submission, she was pardoned. The travellers saw the widow
no more, and the serious consequences by which this singular
adventure was likely to be followed, made them resolve to be more
cautious in future in giving encouragement to the
advances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> of the
African ladies. But Zuma was not the only belle of distinction who
wished to attach herself to Clapperton. He was, while at Wawa,
haunted even to annoyance by another lady of high rank. “I was
pestered,” he says, “for three or four days by the governor’s
daughter, who used to come several times in the day, painted and
bedizened in the highest style of Wawa fashion, but always half
tipsy; I could only get rid of her by telling her that I prayed and
looked at the stars all night, never drank any thing stronger than
<em>roa in zafir</em>, which they call my tea—literally hot water:
She always departed in a flood of tears.”</p>

<p>As Clapperton and Lander proceeded on their journey towards
Sackatoo, the latter was seized with dysentery, and while he
continued ill and weak, he experienced the kindness of his generous
master in a very marked manner. Though his own strength was fast
declining, Lander says of him, “whenever we came to a stream which
was too deep to ford, and unfurnished with a ferry-boat, being too
weak myself to swim, my generous master used to take me on his
shoulders, and often times at the imminent risk of his own life,
carry me in safety to the opposite bank.”</p>

<p>On their arrival at Kano, Lander was left in that town while
Clapperton proceeded to Sackatoo, the capital of Bello, Sultan of
the Felathas, on whose account chiefly this second mission had been
undertaken. Bello at this<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_109">[109]</span> time happened to be at war, and with his
army encamped before Coonia, the capital of Goobur. Clapperton went
there to join him, was most kindly received by him, and had an
opportunity of witnessing the African mode of fighting in a furious
assault which was made upon the city of Coonia the day after his
arrival in the camp. Soon after this event he reached Soccatoo,
where for about six months he inhabited the same house which he had
occupied during his first visit to that city. The Sultan sent to
Kano and brought Lander and the baggage to his capital, and on
their arrival the baggage was seized, under pretence that
Clapperton was conveying guns and warlike stores to the Sheik of
Bornou, with whom Bello was then at war. He was next ordered to
deliver up Lord Bathurst’s letter to the Shiek, and indeed every
thing which was supposed to form a part of the intended present to
him was seized upon. Clapperton remonstrated against these
nefarious proceedings with the utmost earnestness, but without
effect. He was stript of every thing, and detained himself as a
prisoner. The effect of this treatment upon his spirits was so
great, that Lander declares he never saw him smile afterwards.</p>

<p>He was strongly impressed with the idea that the Arabs had
stirred up the Africans against him and his companions. By their
insinuations against them in the hearing of Bello, they succeeded
in undermining their reputation<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> with that monarch. Clapperton had not been
perfectly well from the day of his arrival in Africa, and the
entire failure of his mission, and the ungenerous treatment he had
experienced at Soccatoo, were the means of bringing on his last
illness and hastening his death.</p>

<p>As long as he was able, while at Soccatoo, he was in the habit
of spending whole days in shooting, dressed in the costume of the
country; his beard was long and flowing, and he lived in a clay hut
like an enormous bee hive. At night he and Lander used frequently
to smoke cigars for an hour or two together; but in every other
respect they lived like the Africans. Sometimes they sung, and
Clapperton was delighted to listen while Lander sung, “My Native
Highland Home.”</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">

<div class="line indent0">Then gang wi’ me to Scotland, dear,</div>

<div class="line indent2">Around my Highland home.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such, during several months, was their almost unvaried mode of
life. On the 12th of March 1826, Clapperton was seized with
dysentery; and the intense heat of the weather<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_111">[111]</span> as well as the feverish state of the
patient rendered it necessary that he should be almost constantly
fanned; a female slave was employed to perform this office, but she
found it too irksome, and soon abandoned her post and ran away. He
grew daily worse, while Lander was oppressed with anxiety on
account of the calamities which had befallen him, and exhausted
with the exertion required in the performance of the various duties
which devolved upon him. As he had a great regard for his master,
we see no reason to doubt the accuracy of his account, that he was
unremitting in his attentions to him during his last illness, which
Clapperton himself attributed to the following instance of
imprudence. “Early in February,” said he one day to Lander, “after
walking a whole day exposed to the scorching rays of the sun, I was
fatigued, and lay down under the branch of a tree. The soil on that
occasion was soft and wet, and from that hour to the present I have
not been free from cold. This has brought on my present disorder,
from which I believe I shall never recover.” A couch was made for
him on the outside of his hut, and during the space of twenty days
he gradually declined, till at last all hope of recovery was
extinguished. In these dismal moments, says his faithful attendant,
he derived consolation and support from the exercises of religion.
Lander read the scriptures to him daily. No stranger visited him
during his illness, except<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_112">[112]</span> an Arab of Fezzan, who intruded himself one
day into the hut, and wished to be allowed to read some of the
Mahometan prayers, but he was ordered to quit his presence. Pasko
who had left his service, and had married and settled in the city,
was taken back, and relieved Lander of a portion of his heavy
tasks. During his illness Clapperton talked much of his country and
his friends. By the advice of Maddie, a native of Bornou, he
swallowed a decoction of green bark from the butter tree, and
speedily afterwards became worse, so that he could get no repose.
On the next day he said to Lander, “I feel myself dying. Take care
of my journal and papers after my decease; and when you arrive in
London, go immediately to my agents and send for my uncle who will
accompany you to the colonial office, and see you deposit them with
the secretary. Borrow money, and go home by Fezzan in the train of
the Arab merchants. From Mourzuk send to Mr. Warrington, our consul
at Tripoli, for money, and wait till it comes. Do not lumber
yourself with my books. Leave also the barometer and every
cumbersome article. You may give them to Mallem Mudey. Remark what
towns and villages you pass through, and put on paper whatever
remarkable thing the chiefs of the different places may say to
you.”</p>

<p>On the 11th of April, he was shaved, and rallied a little, but
soon became worse, and died on the 13th. By order of Bello he
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> buried in an
open place about five miles from the city of Soccatoo, and Lander
read over him the service of the church of England for the “burial
of the dead,” as Clapperton had himself formerly done for Dr.
Oudney and some other of his companions. Next day Lander returned
to the spot, and with the assistance of some of the natives a shed
was erected over the grave.</p>

<hr class="decordb width6 spaced2">

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Major Alexander Gordon
Laing</span>, another of those adventurous spirits who met with
their common fate, in the attempt to explore the interior of
Africa, was born at Edinburgh on the 27th December 1794, and was
the eldest son of Mr. William Laing, A.M., one of the most popular
classical teachers of his day. In his academy, in the New Town of
Edinburgh, young Laing received nearly the whole of his education,
at least all that was necessary to prepare him for the university.
Possessing a quick intuitive perception, and an ardent thirst for
classical knowledge, his progress<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_118">[118]</span> was in proportion; and at the early age of
thirteen, he entered the university of Edinburgh. Here his
attainments became still more marked, and Professor Christison, who
then occupied the humanity chair, observing his literary taste,
used to point him out in the public class as worthy the imitation
of his fellow-students, though few might hope to surpass him.</p>

<p>When about fifteen, Laing went to Newcastle, where for six
months he filled the situation of assistant to Mr. Bruce, a teacher
in that city; he then returned to Edinburgh, and entered upon a
similar duty under his father, a situation for which he was
singularly qualified.</p>

<p>It appears strange that a young man, quietly, and, at the same
time, eagerly, pursuing the laborious profession of a schoolmaster,
should have afterwards adopted another line of life forming a
perfect contrast to that in which he had been previously employed.
The change of his tastes is wholly to be attributed to his
connexion with the volunteers. At a time when volunteering was very
general, Alexander Laing entered one of the corps then forming; and
in 1810 was made an ensign in the Prince of Wales’s Edinburgh
Volunteers, then being in his seventeenth year. Captivated with the
specimen he there had of a military life, he desired earnestly to
be a soldier. He could no longer submit to the restraints and
routine of school discipline; and at the end of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> the second year, he finally
gave up the now to him irksome duties of teaching, to the
disappointment of his parents and relatives, who were very desirous
that he should not change his profession. Being, however, bent upon
the military service, he, in the year 1811, went out to Barbadoes,
where his maternal uncle, Colonel, afterwards General Gabriel
Gordon, then was, with whom he remained a short time till he
obtained an ensigncy in the York Light Infantry, which regiment he
immediately joined at Antigua, and in two years thereafter he was
promoted to a lieutenancy in the same corps—a situation which he
held till the regiment was reduced, when he was then placed upon
half pay.</p>

<p>But anxious for occupation, he exchanged, as speedily as the
affair could be negotiated, into the second West India regiment,
which he joined at Jamaica. While there, he had to discharge the
duties of deputy quartermaster-general, the exertions of which
department brought on a liver complaint, for which his medical
advisers recommended a sea voyage. He accordingly sailed to
Honduras, by which his complaint was considerably relieved, and the
governor, Colonel Arthur, finding him an active, useful, and
intelligent officer, appointed him to the office of fort-major, and
would not suffer him to return to Jamaica, but had him attached to
another division of his regiment then in Honduras, where he
remained till a return of his complaint forced<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_120">[120]</span> him to come home, his frame being so
much debilitated, that he was unable to walk, so that it became
necessary to carry him on shipboard.</p>

<p>His constitution was very seriously injured by this illness, and
in consequence he remained nearly eighteen months with his friends
in Scotland. During this time, however, that half of the second
West India regiment to which he was attached was reduced, and he
was again placed upon half-pay. In the autumn of 1819, he returned
to London, and having been sent for by the late Sir Henry Torrens,
then Colonel of his regiment, was familiarly complimented by him on
his former services, immediately appointed lieutenant and adjutant,
and proceeded to Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>Early in January 1822, Lieutenant Laing was sent by the late
governor, Sir Charles M‘Carthy, on an embassy to Kambia and the
Mandingo country, to ascertain the political state of those
districts, the disposition of the inhabitants to trade, and their
sentiments in regard to the abolition of the slave trade. Sir
Charles was perfectly satisfied with the manner in which his
instructions were executed, and with the information he received on
the different heads.</p>

<p>Having fulfilled the purposes of the mission at Kambia, he
crossed the river Scarcies, and proceeded on foot to Malacouri, a
strongly fortified Mandingo town, situated on the banks of the
river Malageea, about twenty miles N.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_121">[121]</span> by W. from Kambia, where he learned that
Amara had applied to the king of the Soolimas, who had sent a
numerous army to his assistance, by whose means he had taken
Malageea, the principal town belonging to Sannassee, and had made
that chief a prisoner. Here he was also informed, that Amara meant
to put Sannassee to death after the performance of several
ceremonies. The Soolima force was stated to exceed ten thousand in
number, and commanded by Yaradee, a brother of the king, who had
acquired some renown as a warrior. Of the Soolimas, little more
than the name was known at Sierra Leone: they were reported,
however, to be a very powerful nation, residing in the interior, at
a distance of three or four hundred miles to the eastward of Sierra
Leone.</p>

<p>Sannassee having always been upon the most friendly terms with
our government, and the unforgiving disposition of Amara being well
known, great alarm was excited for the unfortunate chieftain whom
he had in his power; Laing therefore, though suffering under a
severe attack of fever and ague, proceeded to the Soolima camp to
mediate between Amara and the captive Sannassee. His account of
this expedition is as follows:</p>

<p>“About two miles beyond the river Malageea, which I crossed near
its source, I fell in with an outlying picket of the Soolimas,
consisting of about fifty men, with sentries regularly posted, to
whom I was obliged to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_122">[122]</span> explain my purpose before the chief of the
guard would permit me to pass: another mile west brought me to a
stronger guard of about one hundred and fifty men; and a mile and
a-half farther to a large savannah or plain where the whole army
was encamped. It was now nearly nine o’clock, and being very faint
and feverish, I was glad to take refuge from the rays of the
morning sun, which, in this part of Africa is the most oppressive
time of the day, under a few bundles of dried grass thrown loosely
upon three sticks fixed apart in the ground at equal distances, the
tops being drawn together and fastened after the manner of military
triangles. These temporary dwellings, when well constructed, form
no bad imitation of, or substitute for, bell-tents, possessing this
advantage, that they can be erected with little trouble, and no
expense, in a short time, whenever an army takes up a position.
From this covering I had a view of the whole encampment, which
exhibited the appearance and bustle of a well attended fair, rather
than the regularity and discipline of military quarters. Tents
constructed as above described, were to be seen covering the
savannah as far as the trees, windings, and other obstacles, would
permit the eye to reach; and the distinguishing flags of the
various and numerous tribes were everywhere to be observed waving
over the habitations of their respective chiefs. Music, a horrid
din of a variety of barbarous instruments<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_123">[123]</span> broke on the ear from every direction;
while parties of men, grotesquely habited in war dresses, were here
and there descried, brandishing their cutlasses, and capering with
the most extravagant gestures, to the time of the various sounds
produced. The novelty of the scene attracted my attention for a
while,—but fatigue, arising from the ague of the preceding night,
at length overcame my curiosity. About noon I was awoke by one of
my followers, who acquainted me that Amara was ready to hold a
palaver with me, and desired my immediate attendance. In my way to
his tent I visited Satin Lai, a designing Mandingo chief,
possessing much power; he had been mainly instrumental in putting
Amara on the throne, and was at this time the only staunch adherent
to the king, who, by following too implicitly his advice, had
lowered himself considerably in the opinion of his head men, who
form the principal strength of an African king. I found Satin Lai,
a good-looking man, apparently between sixty and seventy years of
age, about five feet ten inches in height, affable in his
deportment, with a mild and amiable countenance which is said to be
rather at variance with his actions. He was performing the office
of a commissary, surrounded by several hundred baskets of white
rice, which he was distributing to the different tribes in
quantities proportionate to their strength. In one corner of the
tent some of his slaves were<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_124">[124]</span> employed in cooking, in another his horse
was feeding, encircled with Moorish trapping, spears, muskets, bows
and quivers. On appearing before the tent of Amara, I was directed
to seat myself under the shade of a large booth covered with
cocoa-nut branches and plantain leaves, capable of containing and
sheltering from the rays of the sun upwards of two thousand people;
here the king soon joined me, and the war drum being beat, the
booth was shortly filled with a motley assemblage of armed men.
Booths of corresponding size, erected at right angles, and parallel
to the one in which I sat, so as to form a large square, were also
soon crowded with hordes of Soolimas, Bennas, Tambaccas, and
Sangaras, in all, amounting to about ten thousand men, while the
inclosed space was free to such as were desirous of exhibiting in
feats of warlike exercises, in dancing, and in music. As the
exibitions on this occasion were of the same kind with those which
I afterwards saw in the Soolima country on similar occasions, and
which will be described hereafter, I shall merely observe that
Yaradee, the general of the Soolima army, was particularly
conspicuous in exhibiting on horseback the various evolutions of
African attack and defence. When their performances were concluded,
I had an interview with Yaradee, and obtaining from him an
assurance that Sannassee’s life should be preserved, I took my
leave, receiving many protestations of friendship. A<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> subsequent conversation with
Amara, in which I explained his Excellency’s wishes, terminated my
visit to the camp, which I quitted at sunset, and proceeded direct
on my return to Sierra Leone, where I did not arrive till the sixth
day, having suffered much inconvenience on the journey, from the
effects of increasing illness.”</p>

<p>We have given this account entire, that the reader may
understand the kind of natives that he had to deal with in his
after intercourse with them. His interference seemed here to have
terminated happily for Sannassee, but he was scarcely recovered
from his illness, when it was reported that all his efforts had
been of no avail; and the governor, still anxious to save the life
of his ally, asked Laing again to undertake another embassy for the
same object; he complied, again visited the Soolima camp, where he
found that Amara had set Sannassee at liberty, after first burning
his town, and then plundering his property. Lieutenant Laing did
not waste time in a longer palaver than was just sufficient to mark
the displeasure of the governor regarding their conduct to
Sannassee. He was accompanied on this mission by Mr. Mackie,
assistant surgeon, who, together with Lieutenant Laing, were the
objects of undisguised astonishment to Yarradee, who scrutinized
every article of their dress with great minuteness; and on
observing Laing pull off his gloves, “he stared with surprise,
covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> his widely
opened mouth with his hands, and at length he exclaimed, ‘Alla
ackbar,’ he has pulled the skin off his hands.” Lieutenant Laing
and Mr. Mackie reached Sierra Leone after an absence of six days
and a-half during the whole of which time they had not been under
shelter for a single hour. While upon this second mission he had
observed that many men who accompanied the Soolima army possessed
considerable quantities of gold, and having learned that ivory
abounded in Soolima, he suggested to the governor the advantage to
the colony of opening up an intercourse with these people.</p>

<p>The governor was pleased with the suggestion, and submitted it
without delay to a meeting of the council, when it was resolved,
that Lieutenant Laing should be permitted to penetrate to the
country of the Soolimas, choosing his own road, and the one by
which he could most easily communicate his discoveries. He was now
in the character of a volunteer traveller, a character which he
admirably supported.</p>

<p>This party consisted of Musah Kanta, a native of Foutah Jallon;
two soldiers of the second West India regiment, eleven carriers,
natives of the Jolof country, and a boy, Mahomed, a native of
Sego.</p>

<p>They quitted Sierra Leone in boats on the 16th of April, 1822,
and ascending the Rokelle, slept the first night at Mr. M‘Cormick’s
factory, who, from his name, seems to have<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_127">[127]</span> been a countryman of our traveller’s. They
took the route through the Timannee country, calling upon the
various chieftains and governors who were in their way, from whom
they received passes, but often with difficulty, and only on the
payment of money, and the presentation of articles, sometimes of
considerable value.</p>

<p>While they were upon the point of leaving Rokon, which is in the
Timannee country, the king of the place made his appearance in a
violent rage, and the cause of his grievance, was a Jolofman, who
attended Lieutenant Laing, having had the audacity to dress himself
in a new red slop shirt, which the king considering a more splendid
habiliment than his own, insisted upon having; this the Jolof
obstinately refused; while the king declared it to be the law in
his country, (a law made by himself at the moment) “That any man
dressed better than himself, especially in red, should forfeit his
clothes.” Lieutenant Laing settled this difference by desiring the
Jolof to change his shirt, and giving the king a bar of tobacco and
a dram of rum. After leaving Rokon, the country for a short time
was beautiful and cultivated, and on reaching Nunkaba, they found
the female inhabitants busy with their cotton, preparing it for
spinning.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Toma, though only sixty miles from Sierra
Leone, Lieutenant Laing learned, to his surprise, that “no white
man had ever before been seen there.” He says,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_128">[128]</span> in his journal, “the first appearance of
surprise, that came under my observation was in a woman, who stood
fixed like a statue, gazing at the party as they entered the town,
and did not stir a muscle till the whole had passed, when she gave
a loud halloo of astonishment, and covered her mouth with both her
hands.”</p>

<p>This astonishment at their appearance, was sometimes productive
of annoyance during the progress of their journey. At Balanduco
they found the women busily employed in separating the juicy
saffron-coloured fruit from the palm nut; in squeezing it into
wooden mortars, and in beating it into one common mash, in order
that the oil might be extracted more easily and more commodiously
in boiling. Lieutenant Laing estimated that during the season of
the fruit, they manufactured, on an average, from thirty to forty
gallons a-day.</p>

<p>They now began to feel the fatigues of a long continued journey;
they reached Rokanka on the 25th of April, much fatigued, and
deprived of water, the inhabitants of the village either being
unable or unwilling to supply them with any; and being afraid to
enter the woods in search of it, from the whistle of the Purrah
being heard in the neighbourhood. The Purrah are a sort of “Robin
Hood gang,” who infest the woods, occasionally making an inroad
upon some peaceful village, which they invariably plunder; the
inhabitants keeping hidden, and never attempting any resistance.
They are tatooed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> in
a manner peculiar to themselves, and have gradations of rank in
their community. At stated times they hold assemblies, on which
occasions, the country is in the greatest alarm, for notices are
dispersed abroad concerning them, and the people are obliged to
attend; they settle all differences, and inflict capital
punishments, according to their pleasure, so that in fact, they are
the governors of the country, and Lieutenant Laing says, “that from
the nature of their power, and the purposes to which it is applied,
they will probably be found a most serious obstacle to its
civilization.”</p>

<p>On leaving Rokanka the next day, they came in sight of a stream,
after walking about an hour and a quarter, and having suffered so
much from thirst, for thirty hours preceding, they were so eager to
enjoy it, and indulged so freely in it, that on reaching a town
four miles farther, the whole party were attacked with the most
violent spasms, Lieutenant Laing suffering particularly, it being
six days before he was at all restored to his usual health.</p>

<p>He found some difficulty in procuring permission to depart from
Ma-Bung, which was the name of his present residence, being obliged
to hold a palaver, as they termed it, with the head men of the
place; and it was only after a <em>very long palaver</em> with his
interpreter and them, that he was suffered to depart, upon making
presents of tobacco, powder, white baft, and rum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>This custom of
presenting gifts at every place, was a serious evil, but it was one
without which it was impossible to proceed, and occasionally, his
attendants and the inhabitants engaged in a scuffle, sometimes
difficult to suppress. It is unnecessary to follow his motions
minutely; the reader may find them interestingly and particularly
recorded in his travels published in 1825, and edited by his friend
Captain Sabine.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to mention that on the 7th of May he reached
the last town of the Timmannee country; called Ma-Boom, part of
which was inhabited by Koorankos, in which part he took up his
residence, as through that country it was now his intention to
proceed.</p>

<p>He found very great difficulty in getting away from Ma-Boom,
owing to the greediness and treachery of Smeilla, the head man of
the place, who laid a plan of assault and robbery upon him and his
party, but from which he was preserved by the sagacity of his
servant, Musah, and his own decision. With the other inhabitants of
Ma-Boom he seemed pleased, particularly the Mandingo families, and
the country around, he says, is thickly wooded, and abounds with
rich pasturages, well stocked with cattle, sheep, and goats.</p>

<p>The next station was Kooloofa, where they received a kind but
noisy welcome, being prevented from sleeping during the night by
barbarous music in honour of their visit. “They, one and all,” says
Lieutenant Laing, “thanked<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_131">[131]</span> God for my appearance among them: they said
they could not live without trade, and on that account, if for no
other, they were glad to see a white man come into the country to
open a good road.” He easily received permission to depart from
Kooloofa, and left it with the best wishes of a numerous crowd,
assembled to witness his departure. After passing through several
places, they reached Seemera, where he was as kindly received as at
Kooloofa, the king “thanking God that he had seen a white man, and
would do any thing to help him, as he was sure he could have no
other object in coming to this country than to do good.” While
there the place was visited by a tremendous tornado. The house
where Laing slept being badly thatched, the lightning kept it in
almost perpetual illumination, and, as he himself expresses it, the
holes in the roof gave him the full benefit of a shower bath. He
was detained here a short time, partly by the rain, during which
time the king sent a company of dancers to dance before him for his
diversion. His route, after leaving Seemera, was difficult and
dangerous, he and his party having to endure several heavy
tornadoes, rough roads, and plots laid to rob him of his baggage.
His remarks upon what he observed during this journey must be
extremely interesting to a geologist, and, indeed, to any man of
science, for which, however, we again refer to his travels.</p>

<p>While at Worrowyah, he was entertained<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> by some female singers, the tenor of whose
song, he said, did not please him. They sung “of the white man who
had come to their town; the houseful of money which he had; such
cloth, such beads, such fine things had never been seen in Kooranko
before; if their husbands were men, and wished to see their wives
well dressed, they ought to take some of the money from the white
man.” He was saved from the effects of this advice by one of his
suite called Tamba, who answered them by a counter song. He sung of
“Sierra Leone, of houses a mile in length filled with money; that
the white man who was here had nothing compared to those in Sierra
Leone; if, therefore, they wished to see some of the rich men from
that country come into Kooranko, they must not trouble this one;
whoever wanted to see a snake’s tail must not strike it on the
head.” This song was applauded, and Lieutenant Laing was allowed to
keep his money.</p>

<p>While at Kamato, which he reached on the 29th of May, Laing had
a severe attack of fever, which lasted for several days. As he was
recovering from the attack, a messenger arrived from the king of
the Soolimas, with a party, and two horses, to convey him to their
country, his majesty being very desirous to see him within his
territories. Laing was very glad to accept of the invitation, so on
the morning of the 5th of June, he mounted one of the horses, and
left the Kooranko<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
country for a time. It was not till the 11th that he reached the
royal city, having in his way thither received much kindness and
hospitality from the native head men of the villages through which
they passed; one head man, says our traveller, “took off his cap,
and lifting his aged eyes to heaven, fervently thanked his Creator
for having blessed him with the sight of a white man before he
died.”</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Laing reached Falaba, which was the residence of
the king of the Soolimas, he was saluted with a heavy and irregular
discharge of musketry, which he ordered to be returned with three
rounds from his party, and then alighting, shook hands with the
king, who presented him with two massive gold rings, and made him
sit down beside him. The king and the Lieutenant were scarcely
seated, when his old friend Yaradee, better dressed than when he
last met him, mounted on a fiery charger, crossed the parade at
full gallop, followed by about thirty warriors on horseback, and
two thousand on foot,—the equestrians returning and performing many
evolutions, to the amazement and admiration of the spectators.
After which many other <em>spectacles</em> were exhibited for the
diversion of his guest by the king of the Soolimas. Yaradee was
particularly kind to Lieutenant Laing, saying, “he was a proud man
that day, the first day in which a white man had ever been in the
Soolima country.”</p>

<p>The different chieftains paid homage to our<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_134">[134]</span> traveller, when they saw how highly he
was thought of by their sovereign, and he was teazed with speeches
and remarks addressed to him by a crowd for the pleasure of hearing
him speak, and whenever he did so, they would shout, “He speaks,
the white man speaks.” He said these marks of attention would have
delighted him any other time, but his horse having fallen with him,
he had been precipitated into the water of a marsh he was crossing
at the time of the accident, which brought on an attack of fever,
from which, however, he recovered in about three days. Those who
wish to see an account of the fetes and the excursions, designed
principally in honour of Lieutenant Laing, must read his travels,
in which they will find an interesting account.</p>

<p>Feeling again the intimations of approaching illness, he
shortened his interviews, and came to the great business of the
mission, free intercourse and trade, and the desire of Sir Charles
M‘Carthy to cultivate a good understanding with them; and then
producing his presents, which were considerable, every thing was
adjusted in the most amicable manner: but he had scarcely returned
to his hut, when the fever was renewed with redoubled violence,
and, stretching himself on his mat, he resigned himself to the
disease which for nine or ten days prevented him from rising; three
days of which he was in a state of delirium. On his consciousness
returning he found he had been cupped by one of the country
doctors, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> had
been of great service to him. During this illness his
meteorological observations ceased, and it was, as he expresses it,
“with a grief bordering on distraction that he thought upon his
chronometer, which, as nobody could wind up but himself, had
unavoidably gone down.”</p>

<p>It was on the 1st of July that he found himself able to write a
few lines to acquaint his friends at Sierra Leone with his arrival
at Falaba, and that he hoped soon to be able to go even farther
eastward; two natives of Soolima volunteering to be the bearers of
his despatches. On the 11th, he was so well as to mount on
horseback and take a survey of the adjacent country, but from the
delay occasioned by the unwillingness of the king to allow him to
depart, it was not till the 17th of September that he finally
quitted Falaba in order to return to Sierra Leone; having resided
in the Soolima country more than three months. He was on the 9th of
September gratified by the return of the messengers he had sent to
Sierra Leone; he received the packet they conveyed to him with
exquisite delight; but besides the kind letters of his friends,
they sent “tobacco, sugar, a little brandy, which soon disappeared
among the Soolimas, and, though last not least, two pairs of good
shoes, a luxury to which his feet had for some time been
unaccustomed. He was also furnished, through the kindness of Dr.
Barry, staff-surgeon at Sierra Leone, with a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_136">[136]</span> lancet and two glass plates of preserved
vaccine virus, with which, on the 13th, he was permitted to
inoculate a number of children, commencing with those of the king
himself,” who had so much confidence in him, that Laing says “he
believed he would have permitted him to have attempted the most
extravagant experiment upon any of his own family.” If he had
possessed sufficient virus, he continues, “I might have inoculated
all the children in Falaba: the yard was absolutely crowded with
old men and women, holding young children in their arms, and
forming a group worthy of the pencil of a West or a Rubens.” He
very naturally remarks upon it as an interesting fact, “that a
nation so far in the interior of Africa, should have so readily
submitted, at the instigation of a white man, who was almost a
stranger to them, to an operation against which so much prejudice
existed for so many years in the most enlightened and civilized
countries in Europe. When the general prevalence of superstitious
fear from greegrees and fetishes is duly considered, this fact
presents a strong proof of the confidence which the natives of
Western Africa repose in the measures of white people to benefit
them; and affords a no less strong presumption, that their other
superstitious notions might soon be found to give way, in like
manner, to the labours of the missionary: and their present
barbarous habits of obtaining slaves for trade by force of arms, to
the more rational proceeding<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_137">[137]</span> of cultivating the soil for articles of
commercial exchange.”</p>

<p>The day that he quitted Falaba, which, as has been already
stated, was on the 17th of September, the natives in great numbers
accompanied him for a considerable distance, the females making
most extravagant demonstrations of grief; the king accompanied him
a little farther, when a parting took place, which we shall insert
in Captain Laing’s own words, (for while at Falaba, he had received
intelligence of his promotion to the rank of captain). “At length
the old man stopped and said, he was now to see me for the last
time. The tears were in his eyes, and the power of utterance seemed
to have forsaken him for a while. Holding my hand still fast, he
said ‘white man, think of Falaba, for Falaba will always think of
you: the men laughed when you came among us, the women and children
feared and hid themselves: they all sit now with their heads in
their hands, and with tears in their eyes because you leave us. I
shall remember all you have said to me; you have told me what is
good, and I know that it will make my country great; I shall make
no more slaves.’ Then squeezing me affectionately by the hand, and
turning away his head, he gently loosened his grasp, and saying,
‘Go, and return to see us,’ he covered his face with his hands. I
felt as if I had parted from a father. Such remembrances impress
themselves too deeply in the heart to be effaced by time or
distance, and establish a permanent<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_138">[138]</span> interest in the welfare of a country, which
may have a material influence on the after life of the individual
who entertains them.”</p>

<p>The route of Captain Laing and his party back to Sierra Leone
was much the same with that which they had gone when they set out;
most of the head men expressing surprise at seeing him again, they
in general supposing that he had been killed in the interior, and
on the 28th of October, he had the pleasure of being welcomed by
his friends at Sierra Leone, “so many of whom, so much esteemed,
and so highly valued, are now, alas, no more!”</p>

<p>On Captain Laing’s arrival at Sierra Leone, he received an order
to join his regiment on the Gold Coast, without delay, in
consequence of the hostilities which had commenced between the
British government and the king of the Ashantees.</p>

<p>On his arrival on the Gold Coast, he was employed in the
organization and command of a very considerable native force,
designed to be auxiliary to a small British detachment, which was
then expected from England. During the greater part of the year
1823, this native force was stationed on the frontier of the Fantee
and Ashantee countries, and was frequently engaged, and always
successfully, with detachments of the Ashantee army.</p>

<p>On the fall of Sir Charles M‘Carthy, which took place early in
1824, Captain Sabine, who edits the Travels, and writes the preface
from which we quote, says, “that Lieutenant-Colonel<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> Chisholm, on whom the command
of the Gold Coast devolved, deemed it expedient to send Captain
Laing to England, for the purpose of acquainting government, more
fully than could be done by despatch, with the existing
circumstances of the command. Soon after his arrival in England,
which took place in August, he obtained a short leave of absence to
visit Scotland for the recovery of his health, which had been
seriously affected by so many months of such constant and extreme
exposure in Africa, as it is probable few constitutions would have
supported.”</p>

<p>He returned to London in October of the same year, where an
opportunity now presented itself which he had long anxiously
desired, of proceeding under the auspices of government, on an
expedition to discover the course and termination of the Niger. He
was now promoted to the rank of major, and departed from London on
that enterprise early in February 1825, with the intention of
leaving Tripoli, for Timbuctoo, in the course of the summer of that
year. He touched at Malta on his way to Tripoli, where he was shown
every attention by the late Marquis of Hastings, at whose table he
repeatedly dined.</p>

<p>While at Tripoli, he became acquainted with the British Consul,
Mr. Warrington, his business with him producing an intimacy of the
closest nature, which was farther cemented by Major Laing’s
marrying his daughter,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_140">[140]</span> Emma Maria Warrington, an event which took
place on the 14th of July 1825. But he had no time to spend in
domestic life: two days after marriage he set out for those vallies
of death where every preceding traveller had found a grave.</p>

<p>It was on the 17th of July that Major Laing left Tripoli in
company of the Sheik Babani, a highly respectable man who had
resided in Timbuctoo twenty-two years, and whose wife and children
were there still. This Sheik engaged to conduct our traveller
thither in two months and a half; and there, or at his neighbouring
residence, to deliver him over to the great Marabout Mooktar, by
whose influence he would be able to proceed farther in any
direction that might be required, according to information received
as to the course of the river. This Babani is stated by the Consul
of Tripoli, to be “one of the finest fellows, with the best
tempered and most prepossessing countenance that he ever beheld;
Laing, in all his letters, speaks of him in the highest terms of
respect and approbation. As the Gharan mountains were rendered
impassable by the defection of a rebellious chief of the Bashaw,
who had taken possession of all the passes, the small koffila of
Babani took the route of Beneoleed. On the 21st of August they
reached Shaté, and, on the 13th of September, arrived safely at
Ghadamis, after a “tedious and circuitous journey of nearly a
thousand miles.” In the course of this journey,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> Laing reports the destruction
of all his instruments from the heat of the weather, and the
jolting of the camels; his barometers broken; his hygrometers
rendered useless from the evaporation of the ether; the tubes of
most of his thermometers snapt by the warping of the ivory; the
glass of the artificial horizon so dimmed by the friction of sand
which insinuated itself everywhere, as to render an observation
difficult and troublesome; his chronometer stopt, owing, he says,
to the extremes of heat and cold, but more probably to the jolting,
or the insinuation of sandy particles; and to wind up the catalogue
of his misfortunes, the stock of his rifle broken by the great
gouty foot of a camel treading upon it. The range of the
thermometer in the desert, was from 120° about the middle of the
day, to 75°-68°, and once or twice to 62° an hour or two before
sunrise, at which time was observable a great incrustation of nitre
on the ground, which is the common appearance on the surface of all
the known deserts of Africa, from Tripoli to the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<p>When Major Laing reached Ghadamis, he discovered that his
companion, the Sheik Babani, was governor of the town. He
considered him a person of sterling worth, with a quiet,
inoffensive, unobtrusive character, though at the same time not
deficient in decision, but never once suspected him to be a person
of so much importance and influence as he all at once discovered
him to be. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Sheik immediately lodged him in one of his own houses, with a large
garden, and yard for his camels, which were fed at the expense of
the governor. Ghadamis is a place of considerable trade; all the
koffilas to and from Soudan passing through it. The citizens pay
tribute to the Tuaric who inhabit the great Sahara or desert on the
western side of Africa for permission to their koffilas to pass
without being subjected to plunder. The town contains six or seven
thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>Major Laing left Ghadamis on the 27th of October, and arrived at
Ensala on the 3d of December. Ensala is the most eastern town in
the province of Tuat, and belongs to the Tuaric: it is considered
to be thirty-five days journey distant from Timbuctoo. As he
approached this city, some thousands of people, of all ages, came
out to meet this Christian traveller. Nothing could exceed the
kindness and hospitality with which they received him, and Major
Laing returned it, by patiently listening to their complaints, and
administering medicine to their diseases to the best of his
ability.</p>

<p>The koffila left Ensala on the 10th of January 1826, and on the
26th of the same month entered upon the desert of Tenezarof, about
twenty journies from Timbuctoo, a mere desert of sand, perfectly
flat, and quite destitute of all verdure. Major Laing, at this time
was still an enthusiast in his expedition, and, possessed of good
health and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> spirits,
experiencing everywhere, from every person, nothing but good will,
kindness, and hospitality. He particularly mentions the services of
Hatteta, the Tuaric who had accompanied him thither; he also speaks
of the sheik Babani, who, he says, continued “to watch over him
with the solicitude of a father.” Shortly after the arrival of a
letter with these accounts from Tenezarof, reports reached Tripoli,
that the koffila had been attacked by robbers; that the Major’s
servant, as well as some others, had been killed, and he himself
wounded; at the same time adding, that he had effected his escape
to the Marabout Mooktar, who usually resided at a spot only five
days journey distant from Timbuctoo. These reports, though they
created some uneasiness, were not believed, till a letter was
received at Tripoli by Mrs. Laing, indirectly tending to confirm
them. She received it on the 20th of September 1826: it was written
from the desert of Tenezarof. The following extract is what appears
to refer to the circumstances which raised the reports.</p>

<p>“I take the advantage of a Tuaric going to Tuat, to acquaint
you, that I am safe and in perfect health, and completely recovered
from the trifling indisposition which annoyed me on leaving that
place. If it pleases God I shall be in Timbuctoo in less than
twenty days, and in two months afterwards I hope to find my way to
some part of the coast. I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_144">[144]</span> have met with much annoyance from the
Tuaric; few, very few of whom are like Hatteta, and are not, as the
consul anticipated, our friends. You shall know all particulars
from me on my arrival at Timbuctoo, from whence I shall lose no
time in addressing you. I have stopped in the sun to write; pray
excuse it, for I am in great haste, and I write with only a thumb
and a finger, having a very severe cut on my fore finger.”</p>

<p>This cut probably refers to the wounds he had received, but
which he did not wish to mention in a more serious manner.</p>

<p>About the middle of October, new reports reached Tripoli, of
Major Laing’s safe residence with Mooktar, a short distance from
Timbuctoo, but adding, that a Jew servant, and a black servant, who
had accompanied him, had both been killed in an attack of the
Tuaric. The consul wished to believe these reports false, and
flattered himself that they were so, but, unfortunately, they were
too true. Major Laing’s Arab servant, Hamet, arrived at Tripoli,
bringing letters from his master with him, dated Azoad, the 1st and
10th of July, at which place he had been detained for some time
after his escape from the attack of the robbers, in consequence of
a dreadful fever there raging among the inhabitants. In his letter
of the 1st he thus mentions it.</p>

<p>“I was detained,” he says, “to afford assistance to the
sufferers with my medicines;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_145">[145]</span> nearly half the population have been swept
away by its ravages; and among others, Sidi Mooktar himself, the
marabout and sheik of the place; his loss I must regret, for he had
taken a considerable interest in my situation, and had promised to
conduct me to Nooshi; which, I regret to say, his son neither
possesses the disposition, nor the power to do. While attending
Sidi Mooktar, I was seized with the malady myself, and for nine
days, lay in a very helpless and dangerous state, without any
attendance, for poor Jack was taken ill at the same time, and the
surviving sailor never was of much service to himself nor to any
body else. My fever yielded at length to the effects of blistering
and calomel, but poor Jack’s proved fatal, and he breathed his last
on the 21st ult. On the 25th the sailor was taken ill, and died on
the 28th, so that I am now the only surviving member of the
mission.”</p>

<p>He mentions having received permission to proceed to Timbuctoo,
adding, but that “with Timbuctoo, my research must, for the
present, cease, as I have no camels to carry me farther.” No
mention, nor even allusion is made in this letter, concerning the
attack of the Tuaric, but in the one dated the 10th, he says, “I am
recovering rapidly, but am subject to dreadful pains in my head,
arising from the severity of my wounds;” and he speaks of his being
unable to write much “from the mangled state of his arms.” The
statement, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of the Arab servant, gave a clear account of all the circumstances,
and is as follows:—“That they left Tuat, and travelled about eight
hours (or thirty-six miles) each day, making forced marches when in
want of water; that on the 11th day, the koffila was joined by
twenty Tuaric mounted on maherries; that on the sixteenth day from
Tuat, at a place called Wady Ahennet, the Tuaric, armed with guns,
spears, swords, and pistols, fell at once on the rest of the
koffila, consisting of forty-five persons; that they surrounded
Laing’s tent, cutting the canvass cords, fired at him while in bed,
and that before he could arm himself, he was cut down by a wound in
the thigh; that himself (the Arab) received a sabre wound, which
brought him to the ground; that Babani and his people rendered no
assistance, nor were they attacked by the robbers, but he
remonstrated with them, and fetched a marabout in the
neighbourhood, who abused the Tuaric for their conduct, and made
them swear not to molest the koffila farther.”</p>

<p>Laing seems to have thought Babani acted oddly on this occasion,
though he says little on the subject; the Arab saying, “that Babani
one day before the attack, took the belts and gunpowder from me,
and the other black man, and gave them to the Tuaric, but Laing did
not tell me to mention that part, but he objected at the time to
Babani’s giving powder and the belts to the Tuaric.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>The letters
already mentioned, of the 1st and 10th, as having been received
from Major Laing, were the last that were so, and of course, the
Arab’s narrative becomes more important and interesting. He states,
“that Major Laing’s wounds were so severe, as to prevent him
keeping up with the koffila of Babani for some days; and that he
(the Arab) the Major’s servant, Jack, a black boy to whom Laing had
given freedom, and one of Babani’s men, attended him, following
slowly behind; that they all re-assembled, however, at a
watering-place, where they remained two days.” He then mentions
their travelling for nineteen days over a desert; their arrival at
Mooktar, where they were kindly treated, and of the recovery of
Major Laing of his wounds, but his being seized by the fever
already alluded to in his own letters, with the accounts of the
deaths occasioned by it, of Mooktar, the boy Jack, and Harry the
sailor; and that “young Mooktar had promised to take Laing to
Timbuctoo, and bring him back safely to Tuat for one thousand
dollars, which was agreed to, Major Laing saying that he had no
money, but would pay him in other things which he still had. He was
to set off in sixteen days when I left him.”</p>

<p>The Arab had received such a fright, first from the attack of
the robbers, and then from the death of his fellow-servants, that
he determined to leave his master, and return to Tripoli by the
first koffila. “On the very day<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> it left (says Major Laing) when I was in a
very weak state, having barely succeeded in overcoming the severe
fever by which I had been assailed, while as yet the corpses of my
poor Jack, and the sailor were hardly cold, the bearer (of his
letter), unmindful of all laws of humanity, came to me, and said he
wished to go to Tuat along with the koffila; I told him he might
go; I blame no man for taking care of his carcass, so, in God’s
name, let him go. I have given him a maherrie, provisions, so that
he departs like a Sultan.”</p>

<p>This Arab likewise brought a letter from Mooktar to the Bashaw
of Tripoli, mentioning all the occurrences which have been already
detailed, viz. the attack of the robbers, in which Laing’s Jew
servant, and a black man were killed, and the Major himself very
severely wounded; so this affair is placed beyond a doubt, by which
Laing was deprived of almost all his property.</p>

<p>Major Laing promised to write from Timbuctoo, but no letters
having reached Tripoli, the consul became alarmed, and urged the
Bashaw of Tripoli to send out couriers in all directions, to cause
inquiries to be made concerning him. On the 20th of February 1827,
the courier returned from Ghadamis bringing letters for the Bashaw
and the consul, stating that a Tuaric had seen one of Mooktar’s
sons at Tuat, who told him that Major Laing was in Timbuctoo in
good health and spirits; stating however that inquiries were
carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> going on
fully to ascertain the truth of it. On the 31st of March the consul
was made acquainted with the answers to these inquiries concerning
his son-in-law: “they stated that the Christian who arrived at
Timbuctoo with Mooktar’s son had been murdered; that the Fellatas
took Timbuctoo and demanded that the Christian should be sent away,
or they would plunder the town; that the people of Timbuctoo
assisted him to escape, and gave him a man to conduct him to
Bambarra; that the Fellata, apprised of this, followed him on the
road, overtook him, and put him to death.” Reports of a
contradictory nature, however, reached the consul, mentioning that
though the Fellatas had entered Timbuctoo, that Laing had escaped
unhurt, and that it was understood he had arrived at Sansanding, on
the banks of the Niger. The same story being repeated by one
Abdullah Benhahi, who, in August 1827, had been in Timbuctoo three
months before, and who saw Laing in that place.</p>

<p>But since that time, however, the reports of his death have been
confirmed in a manner that leaves no doubt in the minds of his
relatives of the melancholy fact, and these authenticated accounts
record, that he fell by the hands of the barbarians, under the fiat
of the king of the Foulahs, long the inveterate enemies of the
Soolimas, by whom, the reader will recollect, Major Laing was so
kindly received, and with whose king he contracted so
interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> an
acquaintance, or rather friendship, residing, it will be
remembered, for three months in their capital of Falaba. The
accounts of his death state, that it took place soon after the 21st
of September 1826. We shall conclude this slight sketch of Major
Laing, by extracting some remarks from an able article in the
Quarterly Review, to which we have been indebted for some of our
information regarding his last journey.</p>

<p>“We trust, (says the Reviewer) that there will be an end to the
sacrifice of valuable lives, in prosecuting discoveries on this
wretched continent, of which we know enough to be satisfied that it
contains little at all worthy of being known; a continent that has
been the grave of Europeans, the seat of slavery, and the theatre
of such crimes and miseries as human nature shudders to think of;
where eternal war rages among the numberless petty chiefs for no
other motive than to seize the innocent families of the original
natives, and sell them into perpetual slavery. The products for
commercial purposes are few, and mostly confined to the sea-coasts;
two-thirds of the interior being a naked and unhospitable desert,
over which are scattered bands of ruthless robbers.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class=

published lately by John M‘Diarmid, Esq. Editor of the Dumfries
Courier, it is stated, that while under the tuition of Mr. Downie,
he catered successfully for newspapers, both for the benefit of his
master and that of himself; and one gentleman he was in the habit
of applying to, once said to him, though merely in joke, “What
makes you come always to me; do you suppose you have a right to
borrow all my papers?” At first the boy was rather abashed; but
rallying in a moment, he presently replied, “I am sure I neither
dirty nor keep them long, and your maids, I can tell you, hang all
your washings to dry on Mr. Downie’s hedge.”—<em>Sketches from
Nature</em>, p. 324.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class=
"label">[6]</span></a>M‘Diarmid’s account of this matter is to the
following effect, namely, that at the age of seventeen Clapperton
became cabin-boy to Captain Smith of the Postlethwaite of Maryport
having been recommended to him by the late Mr. Jonathan Nelson of
Port Annan; that after he had made several voyages across the
Atlantic in that ship, he was detected at Liverpool in the act of
smuggling a few pounds of rock salt, to please the landlady of a
house which he frequented; that after he had pled his ignorance of
the revenue laws in mitigation of the terrors of trial and
imprisonment with which he was threatened, he consented to go on
board the Tender. Sketches from Nature, page 325. The whole of this
account shows that the circumstances both of his entrance upon a
sea-faring life, and into the royal navy, are now altogether
unknown; or at least involved in great uncertainty.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class=
"label">[7]</span></a>M‘Diarmid’s version of this important passage
of Clapperton’s life is, that after he had by compulsion become a
sailor on board a man-of-war, he wrote to Mr. Scott, banker in
Annan, describing his situation and soliciting his interest; that
Mr. Scott applied to General Dirom, and that the General applied to
Sir Home Popham, while his lady applied to her cousin Captain
Briggs of the Clorinde, and by the aid of these combined and
powerful applications in his behalf, Clapperton was raised to the
rank of a midshipman. This is the first time we ever heard that the
youth was an object of interest to so many honourable individuals;
but when they claim the merit of having been the means of promoting
him to the rank of midshipman in the navy, they claim more than
their due; because it can be proved by the date of documents still
in the possession of a near relation of the traveller, that he was
a midshipman long before he was known to Captain Briggs of the
Clorinde.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class=
"label">[8]</span></a>Since the above account of this transaction
was printed, we have been informed on unquestionable authority that
Clapperton, though without his own knowledge, was in reality
indebted to his uncle for the first step of his promotion in the
navy. The matter had been agreed upon between Colonel Clapperton
and Sir Thomas Livingstone. The situation in which he had
discovered his nephew, not only in the condition of a common
sailor, but under the disguise of an assumed name, was not fitted
to lead to great familiarity between them when they first met. But
after the nephew had become a midshipman, and had resumed his own
name, the uncle took him to the shop of a Scotsman in Gibraltar,
and fitted him out with every thing requisite for his new
situation, and recommended him to the patronage of his friend Sir
Thomas Livingstone.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class=

contribute.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class=
"label">[10]</span></a>The following anecdote is transcribed from
M‘Diarmid:—</p>

<p>“At this period, and before the Asia had weighed anchor, an
incident occurred which illustrates very strikingly his
characteristic coolness and intrepidity. One evening, the alarm was
given that the ship was on fire; the drums immediately beat to
quarters, and the firemen were piped away to the gun-room, where an
immense quantity of luggage had been temporarily deposited, and
from whence were issuing huge and increasing volumes of smoke. The
after-magazine, containing some hundred barrels of gun-powder, was
immediately beneath, and the appearance of the combustion had
become so alarming, that every man awaited his fate in silence,
under an impression that the ship would speedily be blown to atoms.
At this awful moment, which will recal to every mind Campbell’s
striking description,</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">“As they drifted o’er their path,</div>

<div class="line indent0">There was silence deep as death;</div>

<div class="line indent0">And the boldest held his breath</div>

<div class="line indent14">For a time”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">my informant, Mr. Archibald Blacklock, one of the
assistant surgeons of the Asia, left the deck, and on passing
through the cock-pit, observed a midshipman in the larboard birth,
sitting at a table, and very quietly smoking a cigar. The sight
surprised him, and on discovering that the smoker was his friend
Clapperton, he could not help marvelling at his seeming apathy. The
other, however, was quite cool, and stated, ‘that he was only a
supernumerary; that no particular station had been assigned to him;
and that if the ship blew up, as seemed very likely, it was of
little consequence where he was.’ But the seat of the fire was
fortunately discovered, and the flames subdued with admirable order
and presence of mind, which are never more apparent than in ships
of war during moments of danger; and on the first of February, the
Asia and Superb weighed their anchors and stood out to
sea.”—<em>Sketches from Nature</em>, p. 330.</p>
